<h2>The Seventh Jini Community Meeting III</h2>
<p>
This is the third of a set of blogs 
from the Seventh Jini Community Meeting
held in Cambridge, Massachusetts March 23-25, 2004.
</p>
<p>
<b>caveat</b>: I should remind everybody that these are
my observations and thoughts and not necessarily of those 
of my employer, any other member of the Jini community, 
or indeed anyone else on the planet. I'm a member of the
Jini development team so these next few blogs will be
"a little closer to home" than the essays I've done for
Artima previously. Well, consider yourself warned! <grin>
</grin></p>
<h2>The First Day Wrap-up</h2>
<p>
I posted some notes from yesterday's Community Meeting
last night as I was leaving the Charles Hotel here in Cambridge.
The good folks in the Business Services office let me grab
one of their loose CAT5 cables and hook up without asking
me to reach for my wallet (thanks, guys!). Here are some 
additional observations from that first day.
</p>
<p>
The Charles Hotel in Cambridge provided a lovely venue
for this event. The space allocated to us was located 
in an isolated part of the hotel, which was ideal. Two 
meeting rooms, one large, one a bit smaller, were 
equipped with comfortable chairs and excellent AV
facilities. Everybody could see, could hear, and sat
comfortably while they did it. [Sad as it sounds, 
I've been to several seminars where this could not be
said.]
</p>
<p>
Upon arrival early Tuesday morning I was met by Joan
MacEachern and Susan Snyder (who worked with Jim
Hurley and Jennifer Kotzen to organize the event) who
gave me the standard kit of goodies one gets at such
a meeting: agenda, survey, etc. 
</p>
<p>
I'd not had a chance to look at the preliminary 
agenda published on Jini.org before arriving. The
agenda was <i>beefy</i>! The larger room held the
entire group and was used for the keynote by Ken
Arnold and would also be used for about half of 
the "breakout" sessions. The other breakout
sessions were held in the smaller, adjacent room.
The first set of breakout sessions presented my
first headache: which session should I go to?
</p>
<p>
<b>Jini Service Container Specification, Implementation
and Usage</b> with Mark Brouwer and Igor Fisl was certainly
going to be interesting. I'd actually followed some of
what they had been doing and would have loved to have
see their talk. But, the other breakout session in
the next room was <b>Jini and .NET</b> by the 
Alexander Krapf of Codemesh also sounded very interesting!
Which one should I attend?!
</p>
<p>
I then had a thought that was both good and horrible:
what if this was going to happen for the entire conference?
I started scanning down the list and it was clear this 
problem wasn't going to get better. The very next two
breakout sessions (same time, different rooms, you've
got to choose!) were <b>Experiences and Successes in
Moving Jini Lookup Services to Embedded Devices</b> by
Cameron Roe of Psinaptic, and <b>Driving Jini Adoption
- A Developer's Perspective</b> by Dan Creswell of
Lone Crusader Ltd. (and the Blitz project). Drat!
Both sounded good!
</p>
<p>
I did choose, as did everybody else. At lunch, after
having navigated another dilemma between <b>Jini
Inside: The Canadian Virtual Observatory</b> with
Patrick Dowler of the National Research Council of
Canada and <b>Jini and Web Services: Judy Project
Overview</b> by Dale Asberry, I talked with a number
of other attendees about the problem and discovered
I wasn't the only one struggling with these choices. 
</p>
<p>
I don't want to sound like I'm complaining! This is
a great problem to have! The meeting was going to last
about two-and-a-half days and there was no way I was
going to be able to see it all. Too many good speakers
and interesting topics; too few slots to put them in.
</p>
<p>
I was thankful that some of the biggest draws were 
to be presented "unopposed". <b>Jini Technology at Orbitz</b>
by Steve Hoffman, Chhaya Dave, and Warren Nisley (discussed
in one of yesterday's blogs) was one such example. It
would have almost been unfair to any speaker to pit them
against this presentation. Most of the Jini community has
yet to come down from all the good press we got at the recent
developer's conference here in Boston where the keynote
speaker from Orbitz put Jini's role in their success 
front-and-center. 
</p>
<p>
After the last presentation, several of us 
(OK, more like 25 of us) trundled off to John
Harvard's for dinner and a cold drink. 
So, as you can see, I was faced with yet 
another set of choices: <b>Drink beer, Eat</b> with
25 of my closest Jini friends, or <b>Edit and Grammar
Check my Blog</b> done in isolation and loneliness.
Hey, I'm a nerd... but not <i>that</i> much of a nerd!
As I said, I stopped by the Business Center, uploaded
my typing, and headed for the exit. And so it goes for
day one.
</p>
<h2>Waldo - Starting Day 2</h2>
<p>
After a few introductory remarks by Jim Hurley, the 
second full day of the Community Meeting began in 
earnest with a talk by Jim Waldo entitled <b>Challenges
in Building an Infrastructure for Medical Sensing Networks</b>.
For those of you who didn't get the memo, Jim Waldo, one
of the inventors of Jini Technology, transferred out of
the Jini group in Sun and returned to Sun Labs where I 
assume he hopes to use some of this cool technology we've
created to solve interesting problems. This talk 
discusses one of those problems.
</p>
<p>
At first,there was a small problem with X11 not wanting to 
understand the shape of the world that prevented his
slides from successfully appearing on the big screen
in the front of the room. No matter, that just freed
Jim to begin talking off-the-cuff (which is more informative
and more entertaining than almost anyone's carefully 
prepared remarks). Finally, after a bit of fiddling by
yours truly, the AV problem was solved and Jim was off
and running.
</p>
<p>
Jim's description of the problem to be solved was 
sobering--and not just from a technical point-of-view.
It has become increasingly clear that the medical
infrastructure in this country cannot keep up with
the demands that will be put upon it by the aging and
retiring baby-boomer generation. This is no small
shortfall, either. He kept using terms like "order
of magnitude" and "factor of 40" to describe the
kinds of shortfalls likely to be in store for all
of us (at least in my age group). So, what's the
answer?
</p>
<p>
One observation is that a great deal of energy is
spent on monitoring a given patient, even when 
the analysis after the monitoring is "you're fine."
Another observation is that some folks go into
denial just about the time they have a major health
event such as a heart attack. Some people who
aren't having a heart attack think they <i>are</i>
having one; others who actually <i>are</i> having
a heart attack aren't so sure. Being sure helps
both patients.
</p>
<p>
What more could be done here? Well, besides avoiding
unnecessary trips to the hospital for those patients
who are fine there are other options for those who 
have had the heart attack such as calling an 
ambulance (GPS linkage), triggering medication, 
notification, etc. Instrumenting patients, though, 
is only half the problem. How do you get all that
data from the patient to someplace that can make
use of it?
</p>
<p>
Well, Jini addresses some of this... but not all of
it. There are some very hard problems here including
privacy, scalability, reliability, storage management,
data channel throughput considerations, analysis tools, etc. 
This is a big, wide-open problem. Just the kind of
problem Jim likes to think about. 
</p>
<p>
I can't possibly do justice to what Jim discussed here.
So, I encourage you to follow his progress. I'm sure it
will be interesting.
</p>
<h2>Wall Street</h2>
<p>
It is difficult to imagine an arena more competitive and
environment more harsh for a product than Wall Street. I danced
around the fact in my last blog that Jini has now been used
in production systems that have money associated with it. In
this blog, I'd like to tell you about an initiative undertaken
by INVESCO. 
</p>
<p>
Van Simmons of INVESCO talked to the entire group with
his presentation <b>Wall Street, Grid Computing and Jini -
Large scale deployment of computational resources in a 
hosted environment</b>. That's a mouthful for sure, but
the talk was interesting.
</p>
<p>
Using the standard compute-server model typically deployed
with a JavaSpaces(TM) service, INVESCO was able to automate
the evaluation and risk assessment for their portfolio. They
also had a number of important, and funny, observations 
along the way. 
</p>
<p>
If you have an opportunity to do so, try to locate the slides
and even the audio program recorded from this session to get
the full effect. Like I said in yesterday's blog, you know a
technology is mature once people begin putting money through 
it. This couldn't be more true here. This is Jini on Wall
Street!
</p>
<h2>Just One More Day</h2>
<p>
I'm typing this in Dan Cresswell's (Blitz project/Lone Crusader, Ltd.)
talk on <b>A Blueprint for Constructing Resilient Stateful Jini
Services</b>. Again, like so many of the other presentations, we were
treated to more smart people tackling hard problems.
</p>
<p>
Now, all that's left today is the Jini Licensing discussion and that 
long train ride home. Thursday, the last day, is only scheduled to
be a half day but still promised to be busy. I'll try to report one
last time at the conclusion of these festivities.
