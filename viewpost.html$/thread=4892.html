<p>
<p>When I posted my last entry, I realized that I might be stirring up a
  hornet's nest. Indeed, I could hear the buzzing just before I pressed
  the <i>submit</i> button, and almost decided against it. Such good sense
  has never been my hallmark in the past, however, nor did it overcome my
  hope that I wouldn't regret the posting. While I don't regret it, it has
  been instructive to listen to the replies. Some have been well-thought out,
  others not so much. But the replies did make me realize that I had posted
  in haste in one respect, since the main points I was trying to make have
  not seemed to have come through clearly.

  <p>So I'll try again. I'm hoping that the second time will be the
  charm. Either I will make my points more clearly, or I'll realize that they
  can't be made. So here goes...

  <p><b>Point one: Just because something is called a standard doesn't
  make it open; and something that isn't a standard is not, because of that,
  proprietary.</b> The standard/non-standard and open/proprietary
  dimensions are orthogonal. Certainly, there are lots of technologies that
  are standards and are also open, but there is no causal connection between the
  two properties. Just look at the controversy in a number of standards groups right now
  as to the granting of intellectual property when contributing to a
  standard. If being a standard made something open, there would be no such
  controversy. In the same way, there are things that aren't standards that
  are quite open...look at most of the open or community software that hasn't
  been formally standardized. The source code is free for the taking; the
  reuse of that code is determined by more or less restrictive licenses. There
  are plenty that are very open, even though they are not standard.

  <p>The real point here is that whether something is open or proprietary
  depends on things like the licensing model, the intellectual property
  grants, and other sorts of legal notions around the technology. Whether or
  not something is a standard depends on acceptance by some standards
  group. Barring some connection between the two (which, by the way, a number
  of standards groups are trying to construct), there is no connection
  between the two. A simple point, but one that often gets lost.

  <p><b>Point two: A standards body is often a lousy place in which to
  invent a technology.</b> This is the essence of what I was trying to get
  at by distinguishing between <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i>
  standards. Technology, I would claim, is best invented or designed by one
  person or a small group of people, working together for a common goal that
  all of them understand and agree to. While there can be a standards group
  that meets this description, it is rarely the case that standards groups
  do. More generally, such groups are made up of a rather large group, each
  member of which is pushing for the good of his or her own company or
  interest group. Such a group can actually be a good thing if you are trying
  to determine which of a group of existing technologies will get the widest
  adoption, but they tend to be bad at creating a coherent, efficient, and
  elegant design from whole cloth.

  <p>This doesn't mean that such a group can't ever produce a good
  technology. There is no logical impossibility that is meant to be implied
  here. And while I would be surprised, I could be convinced that a good
  technology had actually been created by such a diverse group. But I don't
  personally know of any examples.

  <p>Notice, by the way, that there can be a small group of people with a
  common goal who work together towards an understood and agreed to end that
  calls itself a standards group. Many of the IETF's early working groups
  were just such organizations. But once a standard is seen as commercially
  important, it is much less likely that the standards group will be made up
  of such technologists. Again, this is a personal observation, not a logical
  truth. 

  <p><b>Point three: The previous posting was not a veiled (thinly or
  otherwise) attack on any particular standards group or collection of
  standards groups.</b> I was not trying to pick on J2EE, or XML, or SOAP,
  or W3C, or IETF, or... I actually don't watch the standards groups closely
  enough these days to want to pick on any particular group. There is blame
  enough to go around in this area. I do remember, about a year ago, when I
  was paying enough attention to notice that there was a new standards effort
  starting up on average of once a week, and a new standards organization
  starting up on average of once a month. Many of these groups and
  organizations were trying to standardize the same activities. Which leads
  me to...

  <p><b>Point four: If there are multiple groups competing to write a
  standard for the same thing, it is probably a safe bet that the technology
  being standardized isn't ready for standardization.</b> This is the
  point I was really trying to make, but didn't state explicitly. But this is
  the one that I think is important for all of us who are trying to produce
  and use technology to understand.

  <p>It is unfortunate that many technology businesses have decided that it
  is a good competitive strategy to declare their own solution to some
  problem a standard, and label other approaches to that problem
  proprietary. Often this is done by creating a standards group which will
  give that company (or some small set of companies) enough cover that they
  can claim that the standard is in fact independent. Recently, this has gone
  even a step further, as companies start us standards groups
  to <i>create</i> a standard technology.

  <p>There is no one company that is doing this sort of thing; indeed, this is
    another area where there is plenty of blame to go around. But it doesn't
    matter what company or group of companies is doing it; it is a bad thing
    for innovation. The whole point of this exercise is to try to pre-empt
    any innovation in an area, and instead negotiate some solution that will
    advantage the founding companies in an attempt to force the industry into
    adopting that solution. The adoption is driven not by the technical
    excellence of the approach, but because it is a <i>standard</i>. This
    is the sort of thing that I find objectionable, and the sort of thing
    that I believe hurts the industry. 

  <p>Once again (re-read point three), I'm not trying to single out any
  particular standardization effort. If you are involved in some standards
  group and think I'm talking about you, then perhaps I am, but not about you
  only. There are lots of examples, and when I'm writing this I really don't
  have any particular example that I am talking about.

  <p>What I'm really talking about, I'm afraid, is an industry that has lost
  the courage to actually innovate on the belief that a better solution will
  win in the marketplace. Instead we now have an industry that seems driven by
  the hope that the marketing noise made around establishing a fake standard
  will make our customers forget that there is little of value that we are
  providing. Such an industry is ripe for harvesting by some company (probably
  a small one) taking over by introducing something that is really
  innovative. We can all think of examples of where this happened in the
  past. I don't think things have changed so much that it won't happen again
  in the future.
