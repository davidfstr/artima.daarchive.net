<p>
<p>While JavaFX Script aims to simplify things for
web designers, a collection of technologies
including JRuby, Rails, NetBeans, and Glassfish
combine for an unparalleled application development
experience. This post focuses on those development
technologies.</p>
<p>I've heard a lot about how easy it is to develop
web applications using Rails, but now I've
actually <em>seen</em> it. At one of their several talks
on JRuby and Rails at JavaOne, Charlie Nutter and
Tom Enebo stepped through the process and took
the audience on a short tour of the application
structure.</p>
<p>At each talk, Charlie asked the mostly-Java audience,
"By a show of hands how many people really love their
development process for web apps?" There were
staggeringly few. But Rails developers, it seems,
are rabid about it. They love doing it. So let's
see how the other half lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong> It's still an open question as to how
much they love maintaining an app they built
a while ago--or someone else's app. That's where
Java's readability really shines. I'd love to see
a straw pole on that topic, one day.</blockquote>

<li>JRuby Futures</li>
<li>Resources</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="why-rails" name="why-rails">Why Rails?</a></h1>
<p>There are a number of reasons to like the Rails
framework for web development:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>The "Convention over Configuration" mantra</strong> keeps
things simple. You follow some basic naming conventions
and the framework figures things out for you--so if you're
looking for Person with ID=Fred, Rails will go to
the database, access the People table, find the
row with right ID, wrap it's contents in a Person
object, and deliver it back to you.</li>
<li><strong>The database specs are agnostic</strong>, so you
can easily migrate to a different database later.
That makes it easy to develop your app with a test database
and later deploy with a production version.</li>
<li><strong>You can define database migration scripts</strong> that
make it possible to rollback to a previous version
of the schema for testing and bug fixing.</li>
<li><strong>There are libraries</strong> for login, authentication, and
other common web application tasks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Rails also gives you an agile development environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>You have a fully functional app</strong> right from the
start that you can incrementally extend to add the
behaviors you need.</li>
<li><strong>You can iterate quickly.</strong> Ruby is interpreted,
so there is no need to recompile the app, redeploy it,
or restart the server. You just make the changes you need
to make, then run your tests or try it out interactively.
That's all there is to it.</li>
<li><strong>The testing harness is built into the framework.</strong> You
have a place for your tests right from the start, and
many of the code generating functions create an initial
set of tests--so you're encouraged to test as you develop--and
that is the <em>key</em> to keeping it fun.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Rails also gives you the benefits of Ruby. It takes a lot
less code to get things done in Ruby and Rails--to the
point that development time can be measured in days, rather
than weeks. Ruby has many features that conspire to
make you more productive. Even if no one feature
is compelling by itself, those features make Ruby great for
writing the "glue" that ties libraries and components into
an application:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Fully OO:</strong> Everything is an object, so there is no
need to remember different ways of doing things
for primitives.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Dynamic, but strongly typed:</strong> Once assigned,
a variable stays true to type.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Literals</strong> for regular expressions, lists, and hash maps.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Powerful string processing,</strong> including multi-line
strings and string interpolation (put #{x} in a
string, and the value of x is inserted inline).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Blocks:</strong> Snippets of code you pass around and invoke.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Closures:</strong> Snippets that know their context, so this
code knows about the File object, and knows to close it
when the block has finished executing:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
File.open(someFile) { |f| ... }
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>"Duck" typing:</strong> If it quacks like a duck, then for
all intents and purposes, it <em>is</em> a duck. If it has the
methods you need, it works. You don't have to declare them
in advance. (But since there is no interface to remind you
to implement them, you have to do more testing--which is a
good idea in any case.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruby is also a better language for metaprogramming
and building domain-specific languages (DSLs):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Open classes:</strong> You can literally "extend" a class
by adding behaviors you need to that class.</li>
<li><strong>Module mix-ins:</strong> You add stuff to your class by
"requiring" a module.</li>
<li><strong>Hooks</strong> like method_missing and method_defined that
let you implement dynamically adaptive behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection behaviors,</strong> so x.send(:y args) is
equivalent to x.y(args)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruby has a terrific ecosystem, as well. You not only
get Rails, you get a variety of other utilities that
take advantage of Ruby's ability to define a higher
level language that is tailored for a specific domain:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Rake:</strong> A powerful build utility.</li>
<li><strong>Raven:</strong> Ruby's implementation of Maven.</li>
<li><strong>Rspec:</strong> A testing utility in which each test
is literally a functional specification.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>There certainly is a lot to like. (For more on the features
that make Ruby great, see the articles in the Resources.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="create-and-test-a-rails-app" name="create-and-test-a-rails-app">Create and Test a Rails App</a></h1>
<p>All of those features are terrific, and they got me
into Ruby. But knowing about them didn't help me get
started building a Rails app. After two Ruby
conventions, I <em>still</em> didn't know how to create
one. (Ok. So I  could have read a book. I'm lazy. Shoot me.)</p>
<p>But JavaOne is a different kind of convention. I
don't know how the organizers do it, but they manage
to set things up so that most every presentation
explains the basics and demonstrates how things are done.
That makes JavaOne pretty much the best
educational opportunity in town. And
this year, a lot of time was devoted to other
languages that run on the Java platform, including
JRuby, Groovy, Tapestry, and JavaFX Script.</p>
<p>So this year, I got to see how a Rails app is constructed.
Here's an overview of the process:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(j)rails myapp -- setup the project directory
(j)ruby script/server -- start server and see basic page
(j)ruby script/generate -- create parts of the app skeleton
 ...do a little editing...
 ...repeat for other parts of the app...
(j)rake -- build the app
 ...try it out...
</pre>
<p>What follows is a mashup of a couple of demos I saw.
Some of the details are bound to be wrong, but the
notes should serve to outline the process.</p>
<p>The first step was to setup the application:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rails myapp
</pre>
<p>There must have been a configuration step to make
that step work with jruby, but we didn't see it.
The next step was to start the server:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
jruby script/server
</pre>
<p>The default server, Webrick, is built-in, so that's
all you needed to do. Even with no code added, it was
now possible to view <a class="reference" href="../_/http/localhost:8080/index.html">http://localhost:8080</a> and see an
initial start page.</p>
<p>Next, they generated the username/password action for
logging in, along with the unit tests for that behavior:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
jruby script/generate controller test hello
</pre>
<p>The next two steps were single line edits in
very small generated files. The first added
the variable @hello="..." to the action script:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vi app/controller/tests/(target file)
</pre>
<p>The second displayed the contents of that variable
in the view file (an rhtml file that looks a lot
like a JSP page):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vi app/views/hello.rhtml
</pre>
<p>The call looked something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&lt;% someDisplayFunction @hello %&gt;
</pre>
<p>To configure database access (an optional, but typical
part of a Rails app), they copied a small configuration
file, to save a bit of time:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cp ../database.yml config/
</pre>
<p>Then, just for fun, they took a look at the place
where the Rails conventions are defined:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
vi config/environment.rb
</pre>
<p>Next, they set up for database migration, to show
how that works:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
jruby script/generate migration person
vi db/migrate/001_person.rb
</pre>
<p>As you make changes to the database, such scripts let
you migrate the schema and rollback to a previous
version to fix the bug with a command like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
<p>The next step generated the scaffolding for CRUD operations
(create, read, update, delete):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
jruby script/generate scaffold person
</pre>
<p>It was now possible to take a look at some of the
generated scripts:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
app/models/person.rb
app/controllers/people_controller.rb
</pre>
<p>It was then necessary to restart the server (something
which, in general, is only needed after adding or
removing a database):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
jruby script/server
</pre>
<p>Visiting the localhost URL then showed the modified page.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="architectural-overview" name="architectural-overview">Architectural Overview</a></h1>

<div class="section">
<h1><a id="develop-faster-with-netbeans-6" name="develop-faster-with-netbeans-6">Develop Faster with NetBeans 6</a></h1>
<p>Once you have the application skeleton created, you'll
need to add some code. NetBeans 6 will make that process
a heck of a lot easier.</p>
<p>Charlie Nutter's comment underscores that point:</p>
<blockquote>
There is a lot of corporate interest in Ruby IDEs, these
days and a lot of work going into tools support.
NetBeans is the furthest ahead. Some people are even
leaving emacs, to get those features in NetBeans.</blockquote>
<p>Actually, NetBeans is supporting more than just Ruby.
They've been putting in generalized support for dynamic
languages and letting users customize the pretty
printing behaviors (among other things) by making
choices in a dialog--a lot better solution than having
to write a plugin that uses the NetBeans APIs.</p>
<p>With respect to Ruby, Tor Norbye from Sun Microsystems
demonstrated the many capabilities that make life easier
for (J)Ruby developers:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Project types for Ruby &amp; Rails</li>
<li>Integrated gem management</li>
<li>Integrated rake builds</li>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Go to definition</li>
<li>Syntax coloring</li>
<li>Background error detection with red underlining</li>
<li>Gray for unused variables</li>
<li>Bold for a method</li>
<li>Cursor on an variable highlights it everywhere it exists</li>
<li>Cursor on method call highlights all exits</li>
<li>Ctrl+shift+F to reformat code</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As a long time IDE user in Java-land, I have to say
that I desperately missed those capabilities when I
began coding Ruby. I loved Ruby anyway, but I felt
handicapped. With NetBeans, they're back in my arsenal.
Life is going to be <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>To switch between Ruby and JRuby, you change a path
in a configuration file. That turns out to be
important in the early releases, because debugging
works better with native Ruby, for now. But in most
other respects, you'll probably want JRuby. (More
on that subject in a moment.)</p>
<p>For debugging, you get all of NetBeans' normal
capabilities:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Call stack</li>
<li>Local variables view</li>
<li>Evaluate an expression</li>
<li>See threads and switch between them</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>To make all of that work in the early releases,
there are several things you to need to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Switch from classic debugger to fast debugger</li>
<li>Install the rubydebug-ide gem</li>
<li>Use the native Ruby interpreter</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div class="section">
<h1><a id="manage-the-project-with-mingle" name="manage-the-project-with-mingle">Manage the Project with Mingle</a></h1>
<p>Mingle is a web-based application designed for
software projects. It includes functions for
project management, issue tracking, source code
versioning, and requirements analysis.</p>
<p>It's targeted at agile IT projects, and built by
agile developers. So it's worth a look. But it
holds a special place in the heart of the JRuby
developers because, when it came time to create
reliable, scalable deployments, they turned to
JRuby. Their reasoning is given at:
<a class="reference" href="../_/http/studios.thoughtworks.com/2007/5/7/mingle-to-run-on-jruby/index.html">http://studios.thoughtworks.com/2007/5/7/mingle-to-run-on-jruby</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="deploy-on-a-java-application-server-like-glassfish" name="deploy-on-a-java-application-server-like-glassfish">Deploy on a Java Application Server like GlassFish</a></h1>
<p>Once you have your application built and tested,
you need to deploy it to a production server. But
even though it's easy to develop a Rails application,
it can require a lot of work to make it perform well.</p>
<p>For serious scalability, you'll probably want to deploy
on a Java Application Server--for example, the open
source standard in that category, GlassFish. (That
will be especially true when JRuby achieves its goal
of support for database pools and other enterprise
features.)</p>
<p>You may still need to do some performance tuning
eventually, but a fast server can delay the day it
becomes necessary, and make the tuning pay off that
much more when you do it.</p>
<p>As noted by the JRuby speakers, deploying on a Java
Application Server also gives you a major advantage
when you're sneaking Ruby into the enterprise:</p>
<blockquote>
You can deliver a WAR file to the IT department,
and they can deploy it the same way they deploy
any other Java app. They don't have to implement
or support some new infrastructure.</blockquote>
<p>JRuby is just Java byte codes under the covers, after
all. And when you're delivering a WAR, that's what
you're delivering--Java byte codes.</p>
<p>To make that work, you use "GoldSpike"--the tie that
binds the rails from east and west, or in this case,
Ruby and Java. The process is pretty simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Install the GoldSpike gem from the jruby-extra site.
(See the Resources).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Set up a config file with something like the following:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
maven_library, "rome', "rome'. '0.8'
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong> Maven is the Apache Build manager and ROME
is a set of Java utilities for Atom/RSS feeds. It's not
clear from my notes what this step is doing, but I'm
leaving it in with the expectation that I'll be able to
clarify later.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>You then need to set an environment variable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
</pre>
<p>Next, you issue the Rake command to create the war file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rake war:standalone:create
</pre>
<p>That command pulls in the Rails app, along with any gems
and java libraries it uses, and puts everything into a
single, standalone WAR file that is ready to deploy on
your favorite Java application server.</p>
<p>To deploy the WAR yourself, you can issue a command like this one:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
~/glassfish/bin/asadmin deploy myapp.war
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="why-jruby-on-rails" name="why-jruby-on-rails">Why JRuby on Rails?</a></h1>
<p>So, Rails is good framework for web applications. But
why run it on JRuby, rather than native ruby?</p>
<p>Possibly the most important reason is so you can deploy your
Rails application on a Java Application Server, as noted above.
But there are several other reasons for using JRuby, as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Installation:</strong> Windows installations work fine for
native Ruby, and Unix installations work well when they
go to the expected location.
But when I installed Ruby in a non-standard
directory on a Solaris system, several build files had
to be modified--and additional modifications were needed
to enable gems. I got it working, with the help of
the many friendly people on the mailing list, but I
can't say I fully understand what I did, or could
easily replicate the process. Installing JRuby, on the
other hand, is a study in simplicity: Download it. Run it.
That's all there is to it, as long you have a Java runtime
installed somewhere on your system.</li>
<li><strong>Localization:</strong> JRuby takes advantage of Java's
unicode framework for fully localizable applications.</li>
<li><strong>Capability:</strong> Java has a huge volume of well-documented,
tested libraries, and you can access them all from JRuby.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability &amp; Reliability:</strong> The Java platform's native
threads trump Ruby's green threads. And the HotSpot
compiler/interpreter gives JRuby a speed advantage that
JRuby's developers have taken advantage of. (Those speed
advantages apply to all JRuby scripts, in addition to
web apps.) JRuby is
basically on a par with native Ruby today, but performance
has mostly been secondary to compatibility, until now.
That is next major focus for the project. And in the future, byte
code changes are under development with JSR 292 that will
allow for even more significant code optimization.</li>
<li><strong>Startup speed for Java programs:</strong> When a JRuby script
is launching Java apps, there is no start-up overhead,
because the virtual machine is already running. That makes
JRuby the ideal way to launch and manage Java platform
processes--for example, in a Rake build file.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The one item in that list that needs more elaboration is the
way you access the Java libraries from JRuby. Here is a quick
snapshot of the process, using the example the JRuby developers
presented:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
jirb&gt;
include Java -- now have access to java libs
import javax.swing.JFrame
import javax.swing.JButton
import java.awt.event.ActionListener
frame = JFrame.new("Quick App")
frame.set_size(300,300)
frame.show
button = JButton.new("Press Me")
frame.add button
class MyListener
include ActionListener
  def actionPerformed(even)
    event.source.text = "Don't press me again."
  end
end
button.add_action_listener MyListener.new
frame.show
</pre>
<p>Voila! You now have a little GUI app in a few lines of code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>jirb is the JRuby version of the interactive
Ruby interpreter, irb.</li>
<li>You can use Java's CamelCase method names,
or the Ruby-standard underscore-versions,
like button.add_action_listener.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="jruby-futures" name="jruby-futures">JRuby Futures</a></h1>
<p>JRuby has shown remarkable progress in the last year
or so. It has pretty well achieved it's first goal:
Full compatibility with the native Ruby implementation.
(No mean feat, considering that the only "spec" is
embedded in the C-language sources.)</p>
<p>The developers are now closing in on their second
major goal: exceptional performance. (On many measures,
it is already faster. So now they're zeroing in on the
remaining areas that need improvement.)</p>
<p>Their next major targets are to resolve the only
remaining areas of incompatibility: Those modules
that use native C extensions. Since they're not
written in Ruby, the Ruby compiler doesn't help.
They have to be rewritten in Java.</p>
<p>One area in which that impact is keenly felt is in
database support. MySQL works great, and Derby
works ok, along with some other databases, but
there are some that do not work at all. Hopefully,
the open source community will be able to help with
that endeavor.</p>
<p>Beyond that, JRuby's developers intend to focus
on the enterprise-edition capabilities that are
needed for massively high-performance, high-reliability
apps. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Database pools</li>
<li>Stronger WAR deployment</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, they look forward to integrating with more of
the native ruby libraries like the Mongrel web server,
Hpricot, and Rmagick.</p>
<p>All told, it's a very strong story that figures to get
even stronger, with time.</p>
