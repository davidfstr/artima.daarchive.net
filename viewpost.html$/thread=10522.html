<h3>Knowing and Learning</h3>
<p>One of the basic distinctions in epistemology (the philosophical study of
  knowledge, having to do both with what knowledge is and how we get it) is
  the distinction between <i>knowing that</i> and <i>knowing how</i>. These
  are very different kinds of knowing, and have to do with the question of
  where learning good design happens.

<p>Knowing that is a relationship between a person and a proposition; this is
  the kind of knowing that has to do with content. So, for example, we can
  know that a string is a null-terminated array of characters in most C
  programs, but is an object in Java; we know that Bush is president (not all
  knowledge makes one happy) or that Pedro Martinez pitches for the Boston
  Red Sox. There is a lot of education that is centered around expanding the
  set of things that we know that; it is certainly the kind of thing that we
  are used to testing.

<p>Knowing how is a different sort of thing; it is the kind of knowing that
  has to do with doing. We know (most of us) how to walk; this doesn't
  require that we learn the truth of a set of propositions. There are people
  who know the physics of the way a baseball spinning interacts with the air
  to change the nature of it's flight; this is a knowing that but is very
  different than knowing how to throw a curve ball. In at least this last
  case, society tends to reward those who know how more richly than those who
  know that. But such is not always the case. We all know how to do many
  things (healing a cut, recognize visual patterns) for which there is hardly
  any knowing that.

<p>The two kinds of knowing are entwined in interesting ways, especially when
  it comes to education. When learning a new language, we begin by
  accumulating vocabulary, grammar rules, and idioms (all instances of
  knowing that) until, at some magic point, we know how to speak the
  language. I have been told by a number of lawyers that the point of law
  school is to get people to learn to think like lawyers; this is a knowing
  how (and, perhaps, some violation of natural law).

<p>Another way of viewing this distinction is by contrasting
  the <i>content</i> of a field with the <i>technique</i> needed to be a
  practitioner in the field. Some fields (history, physics) have lots and
  lots of content that needs to be learned; others (law, mathematics, art,
  analytic philosophy) are almost all technique. Just as there are different
  ways of knowing, there are different ways of learning. To become an expert,
  you need to learn the content of your field (the <i>learning that</i>) but
  you also need to learn the techniques of your field (the <i>learning
  how</i>).

    <p>All of this has bearing on the question of how we go about training
      software engineers. Most of the academic teaching that goes on is
      centered around knowing thats, if for no other reason than that it is
      far easier to evaluate whether or not someone knows that something is
      the case. But most of what we value in the practitioners of software
      development (and design) has to do
      with knowing how, which is much harder to teach (at least in an academic 
      environment). Knowing how to do something comes from repetition,
      practice, and being corrected as you proceed by someone who already
      knows how. It requires coaching rather than lecturing. Most of all, it
      takes time and doing it wrong.

    <p>Returning to the subject of my last entry, I think that this is the reason a
    lot of training in design happens by serving an apprenticeship with a
    master designer. Apprenticeships have always about learning how to do
    something rather than acquiring a set of knowledge (although knowledge is
    certainly acquired along the way). The process of learning by doing under
    the eye of an experienced practitioner is a great way of learning how, just
    as the standard classroom is a good way of conveying learning that to a
    large group. But we should recognize that the two learning techniques are
    optimized for different cases.

    <p>This is also why, in the corporate world, time spent in graduate
    school is often equated with time spent on the job. For at least the
    first few years of each, what is being served is an apprenticeship. In
    the case of graduate school, it is a professor who is the master; in the
    case of a job, it is the technical lead of the project. The quality of
    the training obtained in either situation is heavily dependent on the
    skills of the person to whom one apprentices, but in both cases much of
    what is learned is not facts about the subject of computer science but
    technique that allows one to be a system designer.

    <p>What I find surprising about all of this is that we
    almost never acknowledge this aspect of the training needed for our
    profession. In this we differ from many other professions. Medical
    doctors have to serve internships and residences (which are, after all,
    just fancy names for an apprenticeship). Lawyers are first associates
    before they become full members of a firm. But often students who have
    finished a degree in computer science think that their training is done
    when they finish school. This lack of Socratic wisdom, this failure of
    knowing what they don't know, often stands in the way of the rest of
    their training, which begins when school ends.

    <p>For the best in our field, the training never ends. Serving an
    apprenticeship may make one a journeyman, and further experience may make
    one a master. But the best of the masters are constantly training
    themselves, either with others who have higher levels of skills, or those
    who have different kinds of skills (for one of the realizations one gets
    is that there are many different approaches to the problems of design, so
    there are always new ones to learn), or by learning from those who are
    learning from them. Being a good designer requires learning all the time;
    it is one of the things that makes design both difficult and rewarding.
