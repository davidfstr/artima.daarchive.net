<p>
<p>I confess. I'm a Ruby hacker, at heart. Ruby's Perl-isms can't go away
fast enough to suit me, but what's left after removing them is a thing of utter beauty and precision. Not to mention power.</p>
<p>But long before I became enamored of Ruby, I was a Java hacker.
I've recently come back to Java, and was rather surprised by the strength
of my reaction--mostly as a result of generics.</p>
<p>I admit to being mildly annoyed by all the semicolons, braces, and parentheses
that the compiler forces me to supply. It makes me feel like a slave, working
for a not-very-bright master. I mean, the compiler <em>could</em> be smart enough to
know what's missing. It just isn't. It prefers to give me an error, instead.</p>
<p>And of course, I miss Ruby's functional coding style, closures, and the flexibility
provided by duck typing, open classes, and dynamic hooks--things that give the
language it's expressiveness and power.</p>
<p>But what's really killing me is generics.</p>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="generics-considered-harmful" name="generics-considered-harmful">Generics Considered Harmful</a></h1>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I continue to admire Generics as a tour-de-force of
implementation genius. Getting them to work in a backwards-compatible way
was nothing less than brilliant.</p>
<p>At the same time, I decry their very existence. They are the ultimate
condemnation of static type checking--because their very addition
has virtually destroyed both the readability and elegance of the language.</p>
<p>To make my case, let's start with a quasi-mathematical definition of
"elegance". In my view, elegance is a function of power and simplicity.
Power is measured by how much you can do. Simplicity is the inverse of
the number of characters it takes to achieve the result. So more power
with fewer characters equals "elegance", in my book.</p>
<p>Of course, by that measure APL is a very elegant language! And it is.
But it's famously unreadable. Somewhere, there is a quote from a very
smart guy who spent 4 days figuring out what a 4 line program did--
a program that he himself had written a few months earlier. That has to
set some kind of standard for unreadability.</p>
<p>So "elegance" has to be tempered with the equally important notion of "readability".
Readability is also a function of the number of characters on the page, but
it has a bell curve: Too few characters, and the code is <em>indecipherable</em>.
But with too many characters, the code is effectively obfuscated. It becomes
impossible to see the forest for the trees. At that point, the code is <em>obscure</em>.</p>
<p>Between "indecipherable" and "obscure", lies the domain of "readable".
That realm is the sweet spot. It's one that Java has been pretty darn good
about occupying.</p>
<p>Until generics.</p>
<p>With the advent of generics, elegance has obviously been impaired (more characters,
same power). At the same time, I claim that generics have pushed the language into
the realm of obscurity.</p>
<p>That is an entirely subjective assessment, I admit. People have different levels of
tolerance for that kind of thing. I mean, there will always be folks who prefer</p>
<blockquote>
SALES MINUS COSTS DIVIDED BY YEAR</blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>to</dt>
<dd>(sales - costs) / years</dd>
</dl>
<p>To each their own. But there is no doubt that with the advent of generics,
Java code is less readable (and therefore more obscure) than it once was.</p>
<p>The result is a two-fold loss--a loss of both elegance and readability--that to
my mind is nothing short of a travesty. It represents the virtual destruction of
a good language at the hands of something that undoubtedly seemed like a good idea
at the time.</p>
<p>When I look at code I've written using generics, and mentally strip out the
generic portions, I can't say that the code is any better or worse than it
was before. Generics just don't seem to be adding any real value.</p>
<p>Of course, generics create greater "type safety" at compile time. And that,
I think, is the ultimate condemnation of static type checking: They show how
much work you really have to do to get it. And what is your return for that
investment? Not much, really. You get a small percentage increase in the
number of real errors found at compile-time.</p>
<p>But to get that marginal increase, you spend more time adding required
syntax, watching the compiler find silly omissions and typos, and making changes
solely to satisfy the compiler. In return, you get code that is less readable.</p>
<p>If all that work produced code that was truly bulletproof, it could easily be
worth the investment of effort. But it doesn't. You still have to do an enormous
amount of testing to get any real quality. And by the time you've done all that
testing, static type checking winds up being superfluous.</p>
<p>Sure, in some super-critical applications like the Mars mission or a stock
exchange, the tradeoff may be acceptable. Even a tiny improvement in quality
is worth a significant investment, because the cost of a defect is so high.
But for day to day programming, the tradeoff just isn't worth it, in my book.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="an-example-is-worth-1-000-words" name="an-example-is-worth-1-000-words">An Example is Worth 1,000 Words</a></h1>
<p>Enough with theory. Let's look at an example.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the "foreach" concept. A phrase like this one clearly
communicates the code's intent:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
foreach item in List {
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>In Ruby, the equivalent mechanism is even cooler, once you get used it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
List.each { |item|
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>It's cooler, because "each" is a method that can be applied to any
collection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidebar: Going Crazy with Functional Expressions
Since every block is an expression, and every expression
returns a value, if you want to go nuts, you could even apply
a dot-operator to the block:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
List.each { |i| ... }.doSomething()
</pre>
<p>Crazy, huh? You wouldn't do that often, but there are times...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Want to iterate over a Map, processing each key/value pair
in turn? Here's the syntax:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Map.each { |key, value|
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>And now here's the equivalent expression in Java, with generics:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for(Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt; e : map.entrySet()) {
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>Sorry, but that's an expression that only a mother could love.
Without generics, it's not too bad. With generics and the
other syntactic elements to required to make it legal, the
statement verges on unreadable.</p>
<p>In general, the trick to reading such loops is to translate the litte
colon to "in" and, once you see the colon, to mentally convert the "for"
in the expression to "for each". So with a simple, "unsafe" loop, when you see
this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (item : List) {
}
</pre>
<p>You read:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for (each) item (in) List ...
</pre>
<p>That's not bad. But lets look at the Map example again. This time,
adding the statements needed to get values to work on.</p>
<p>For comparison, in Ruby we would write:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
map = getInfo();
map.each { |key, value|
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>But in generified Java, we need this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
map = getInfo();
for(Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt; e : map.entrySet()) {
    String key = e.getKey();
    Object item = e.getValue();
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>With the generic declarations added in, plus the need to invoke a
method on the map, and all of the parentheses and angle brackets
that are required, the colon is hard to see. It is effectively lost
amid the noise. You have to peer at the expression carefully to
discern its intent--especially when you come across it in the context
of a larger program.</p>
<p>In fact, it was after copying that very expression from the web that
I became disenchanted with generified Java. For me, Java's
huge advantage from day one has always been it's readability. (The
Web interface library didn't hurt, either. But this is about the language.)</p>
<p>With Java, there was only one way to do anything. There were no #ifdefs
or home-grown macros, so no matter whose code you read, you always knew
exactly what it was doing. So it easy to read. In consequence it was
(relatively) easy to learn.</p>
<p>Ruby is more like Perl, in that regard. There are so many ways to do
things that, to read anyone else's code fluently, you first have to
master the particular set of idioms they employed.</p>
<p>So score one for Java in the realm of readability. Until generics.
A subtle syntax element like ":" can't stand up against the deadly
incursion of ubiquitous type-declaration syntax. To even begin to
compete, it would have to employ COBOL-like syntax--in all caps, at that:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for(Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt; e IN map.entrySet()) {
   ...
}
</pre>
<p>That, at least, would be a little closer to readable. But of course
it would be even less elegant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="but-wait-there-s-more" name="but-wait-there-s-more">But wait, there's more</a></h1>
<p>Things get even a little worse if we want to process the map in
an ordered way, and we assume that the original map isn't necessarily
ordered.</p>
<p>Here's the Ruby expression:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
map = getInfo();
map.sort.each { |key, value|
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? You merely invoke an intermediate sort() method
to get the result you want. It's even more readable because parentheses
on method invocations are only required when they are absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p>Here is the equivalent operation in generified Java:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Map&lt;String,Object&gt; map = getInfo();
Map&lt;String,Object&gt; sortedMap = new TreeMap&lt;String,Object&gt;(map);
for(Map.Entry&lt;K, V&gt; e : sortedMap.entrySet()) {
    String key = e.getKey();
Object value = e.getValue();
...
}
</pre>
<p>Readable? I think not. It takes more than a quick glance to tell
what that code is doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="anticipating-the-counter-arguments" name="anticipating-the-counter-arguments">Anticipating the Counter Arguments</a></h1>
<p>Generics force the programmer to do at something the computer is
entirely capable of doing at run time (type verification). And if
we have learned anything at all about computers, it's to let them
do what they're good at!</p>
<p>When you add generics to the requirements for parentheses and semicolons
(other things the compiler could easily supply), the scales tip quickly
away from readability and elegance.</p>
<p>Of course, runtime type checking makes your code more "unsafe", so you
have to do more testing. But when you're not spending all of your time
adding syntactic "sugar" to make the compiler swallow your code,
you have a lot more time to make sure your code is doing the right thing.</p>
<blockquote>
Note:
That's right. I just called generics "syntactic sugar". In this case,
the sugar makes the code more palatable to the compiler, not the coder.
You have to pour it on, but you don't get to enjoy it.</blockquote>
<p>Equally horrendous, to some, is the fact that runtime type checking slows
things down. But computers are getting faster, the number of programs that
needs to be written is exploding, and the number of programmers available
to write them is shrinking in comparison.</p>
<p>Given that state of affairs, it's hard to see the point of sacrificing
readability and elegance, all in the same breath.</p>
