<b>Summary</b><br/>
Choice leads to quality, but higher standards of quality reduce choice over time. That leads to the vanishing middle: software projects increasingly consolidate into a few large projects, on one hand, and a few small, niche projects, on the other. Smaller projects can turn to transparency of their development processes as a way to gain traction.

<p>
While incremental improvement is best practice in almost every industry, software
stands out in one respect: Users not only help with feature improvements, but also
with quality control.
                                                                                              <p>

Agile development methods all center around developing small pieces of well-tested
functionality, incorporating that functionality into a release, and then obtaining
user feedback on that new release. With each cycle, the software improves, since user
feedback can reveal problems as well as areas for improvements. The more frequent the
cycles, the quicker software quality improves.
                                                                                              <p>

Software vendors who understand the importance of time-to-market seldom hesitate to
use paying customers as an external QA department.  Anyone who used some version
Windows or DOS knows that well. Indeed, many an ISV has fallen due to favoring a
higher quality initial release over capturing market opportunities. Being first and
just good enough proved more advantageous than being best.
                                                                                              <p>

That practice is not limited to commercial software. User-provided bug reports are
what make open-source software so high quality over time, since finding a bug and
fixing a bug can be done by the same person, often at the same time. Smart feedback
mechanisms are now standard parts of many open-source and commercial software
packages.
                                                                                              <p>
<h2>The Quality Wedge</h2>
                                                                                              
This process has worked so well that it now threatens its own existence. Looming
changes in user attitudes are one indication of the impending change, and at the
heart of those changes are choice.
<p>

When I started my software company a few years ago, I, too, counted on receiving user
feedback from early releases. We didn't charge for these beta releases, so I assumed
that users would be happy to download and try new builds, providing us valuable
feedback for future releases, and for the eventually for-pay release. I also hoped
that having many users would improve the quality of the product.
                                                                                              <p>

I was in for a surprise, though. Instead of providing feedback on a free product,
users <em>expected</em> the software to work perfectly from the start. When they
encountered bugs or incomplete features, they complained instead of collaborating to
improve the product. The feedback I did receive at the time was that users were
willing to <em>pay</em> for something that worked exactly as they expected it from
day one, rather than try and evaluate a free or beta product. This proved an
expensive experiment for our company, because we had to provide technical support for
a free product, a required condition for users to even try the software.
                                                                                              <p>

One reason for that reception was choice: Users already had experience with products
in that domain space that had gone through the initial collective debugging
experience. Our users were not forced to try a new product, even if our product
offered advantages over competitors' offerings. The leverage afforded by choice
raised the quality bar for what users were willing to put up with, even for a trial.
Instead of providing feedback, many would-be early adopters wanted a product
that had all the bells and whistles, and that just worked as expected, at first try.
                                                                                              <p>

If you think mine was an isolated experience, consider Linux. In the early 90s, I
would gladly spend many a weekend installing Linux, re-compiling the kernel, hunting
down the specific device drivers that would make my X windows fly. Today, I can
choose from a dozen distros, each of such high quality that a newcomer distro would
have to meet very high user expectations from the initial release. No one, I submit,
will spend weeks re-configuring their computers because that new distro couldn't
figure out what hardware devices were available. Users now have choice.
                                                                                              <p>

Similarly, few users would put up with data loss due to the crash of their DBMS -
there are a dozen high quality, free DBMS projects that do the job so well that a
newcomer to the field would have to meet a high quality bar if they wanted to
cultivate a large user base.
<p>

That trend suggests that established projects - and products - in a given problem
domain will only gain more momentum, and, concomitantly, that newcomers will have a
harder time to gain a foot in the door. Moreover, because of the collective debugging
effect, consolidation in software should produce sharper and more Draconian results
than in other industries. On the one hand, large projects will receive a
disproportionate amount of quality control feedback, allowing their owners to improve
quality at a rapid rate. Smaller projects will always exist to satisfy niche areas,
but the middle ground may be driven out by that quality wedge.
                                                                                              <p>

That has already happened in the Linux distro market where there are five or six
large distros with a huge mind share, and a handful of smaller ones with a tiny user
base. The result of that large user base is that the large distros are of excellent
quality, leaving little incentive for users to try anything else. The same is true
for the Java Web server market, where Tomcat all but dominates the field, as is true
of the Java persistence layer market, the JVM market, or the IDE market. The key
projects receive a disproportionately large percentage of user feedback, which, in
turn, will make them even better.
                                                                                              <p>

Does that mean that it is hopeless to start a new project or product in a domain
where there are already established players? Does it imply that new projects will
eternally be doomed to marginal niche existence? Is there really no room for a middle
ground?
                                                                                              
                                                                                              
<h2>A Transparent Solution</h2>

                                                                                          
The traditional solution to that problem is innovation: A smaller project can gain
traction, provided that it offers a unique and much demanded feature not available
anywhere else. Even then, larger projects will likely swallow those smaller ones.
Large software companies routinely make a sport of "innovating" by buying up small
competitors with fresh ideas. On the open-source scene, observe how the Apache
project has incorporated dozens of smaller open-source projects. For all practical
purposes, Apache has become a Wal-Mart of the open-source Web server universe.
                                                                                              <p>

A more practical solution may take a clue from other fields. In industry, for
instance, when looking for a supplier, a company cannot afford to just order a few
thousand samples and see how that order will work out. And they can seldom afford to
send someone to a vendor's site and have him inspect a large sample before committing
to purchase. Rather, a manufacturer often ensures that its suppliers follow best
practices in making their wares, in the expectation that best practices likely lead
to high quality results. The ISO 9000 standard, or Six Sigma, are examples of a set
of processes that aim to ensure consistently high quality output.
                                                                                              <p>

Likewise, when making a doctor's appointment, we must gain some reasonable confidence
that that doctor's efforts will produce good results and not harm, in advance of our
visit. Again, we often rely on some evidence that the doctor follows best accepted
practice: Doctors often display special diplomas or certificates in their offices as
evidence of their familiarity with best practices in their areas.
                                                                                              <p>

The common element in these examples is transparency of process: A manufacturer or a
doctor are not only willing to let potential customers watch over their shoulders,
but actively declare the kind of processes they use in their practice. Indeed, we
would frown upon visiting a physician who called his office primarily a business, and
not a practice. Transparency of process, especially adherence to best practices, are
what makes it possible for a smaller manufacturer, or an unknown off-shore supplier,
as well as a family physician, to get established.
                                                                                              <p>

A similar solution may be possible in software. If a software project -
commercial or free - publishes the processes it follows in developing its products,
educated users may be more inclined to try those products. By openly publishing the
steps taken to ensure quality, as well as up-to-date key quality metrics, software
vendors can provide buyers and users of their wares with a level of comfort.
                                                                                              <p>

While I still believe that feedback from users is one of the most effective ways to
improve software quality, users may be more ready to go along on the collaborative
debugging and testing ride if they know where the product is on the quality scale at
any given moment, and what processes are in place to gauge and improve quality. In
the highly competitive, abundant environment where users have ample choice,
transparency of process may become a competitive advantage for smaller projects
aiming to grow.
