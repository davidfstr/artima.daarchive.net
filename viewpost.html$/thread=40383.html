<h2>The Seventh Jini Community Meeting II</h2>
<p>
This is the second of a set of blogs 
from the Seventh Jini Community Meeting
held in Cambridge, Massachusetts March 23-25, 2004.
</p>
<p>
<b>caveat</b>: I should remind everybody that these are
my observations and thoughts and not necessarily of those 
of my employer, any other member of the Jini community, 
or indeed anyone else on the planet. I'm a member of the
Jini development team so these next few blogs will be
"a little closer to home" than the essays I've done for
Artima previously. Well, consider yourself warned! &lt;grin&gt;
</p>
<h3>Coming of Age</h3>
<p>
Here are some observations from the afternoon sessions
which backs up my views that Jini has <i>come of age</i>.
</p>
<h3>Orbitz</h3>
<p>
Orbiz has gained a foothold in its market as the third largest travel web site
in roughly the last three years. They are also a monsterously large Jini shop.
With over 1300 Jini-based services running in approximately 300 VMs, it is
likely the largest Jini-based application <i>you</i> will use. That's right,
<i>you</i>. Every time you buy an airline ticket, book a hotel room, reserve a
car, or uses any of the other services sported by Orbitz, a hand-full of
Jini-based services are employed. 
</p>
<p>
You might think that the presentation by Orbitz to a audience full
of Jini developers would concentrate on the general architecture
and specific uses of Jini in the system. Nope. And that's a good
thing. The Jini apsect of the system architecture is reasonably 
straightforward and was described easily in the first part of the
presentation. The remainder of the time, and the thrust of the
talk, was on the <i>monitoring</i> aspects of a large scale distributed
system with Jini-based services.
</p>
<p>
It was subtle, but the message I got from this was clear: Jini
is just another great technology used to construct high-value
solutions... now let's talk about how to manage the deployment.
Consider the alternative views: Jini is new, Jini is risky, 
Jini is obscure, Jini isn't ready for prime time. The presenters
from Orbitz skipped right by any of those doubts and went
directly to we created a great solution with Jini and now
we're working to make it easier to manage.
</p>
<p>
The Orbitz folks had the same asperations I've had when
I have built large systems. They wanted to create a system
that would actively assess the health and efficacy of the
distributed system components and be able to take 
preemptive actions to avoid customer-visible failures.
One of the terms the presentation team (the presentation
was done tag-team style with three engineers) put forth
to describe their goals was <i>autonomic computing</i>--
a term that I know I heard kicked around the Jini group
at least a year before it began appearing in IBM
advertisements. Regardless of the genesis of the term,
the meaning is clear: automation of management, provisioning, and
error-recovery is critical to availability of a complex
distributed system. The Orbitz team has a good idea of
what the next steps will be for their system.
</p>
<p>
At the conclusion of the prepared remark, one audience
member asked what many of us were wondering:
why didn't they just use J2EE? (Or, more appropriately,
how did you get away with <i>not</i> using J2EE for all
this?) Their answer was thus: when they first looked
at Jini, they couldn't help but notice that its <i>cool</i>. But,
besides that, their first impressions of J2EE were that it
was expensive and heavyweight. They do use some J2EE--but
its wrapped behind a Jini-based service(!). In the end, 
the extra machinery, and cost, of a J2EE-based solution 
was a strong disincentive. But, such a statement probably
"damns with faint praise" their view of Jini Technology.
</p>
<p>
The Jini Way(TM) was the best approach based
on the Orbitz engineering team's understanding of the
problem. The problems they were left with, that of 
monitoring the health of the constituent parts of the 
system and responding to problems, is the class of
problems that you'd need to solve for any production
web site. 
</p>
<p>
Again, my impressions from the talk (other than the
Orbitz folks are pretty smart) were this: Jini technology
is a killer technology that's come of age.
</p>
<h3>Countrywide Group</h3>
<p>
Taking something new and carving out a solution from
whole cloth is one thing; taking an existing company
and an existing codebase and converting portions of
a large application suite to use Jini is quite 
another. Countrywide Group, a large insurance provider in
the United Kingdom, had such a challenge and found
Jini's benefits to outweigh any transistion costs.
Their view of Jini and its alternatives were captured
in one sentence near the beginning of their presentation:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Jini was the only way we could maintain all our
generic requirements and our enterprise requirements in a
cost-effective manner."
</blockquote>
<p>
Like the Orbitz presentation, there was a question
that was going to be asked about J2EE. Calum Shaw-MacKay,
the presenter from Countrywide, anticipated the question
and had this early in the presentation:
</p>
<blockquote>
"Why didn't we choose J2EE? Of the vendors we talked to, no vendor 
understood what we wanted to do. They kept talking about XML and
web services but that wasn't what we were trying to do. They
were more helpful in sell us a product than helping us with our
solution."
</blockquote>
<p>
They went so far as to <i>drop</i> an existing J2EE effort
in favor of Jini. That's right: they had J2EE and threw it
out. Why? I'm guessing they were looking for the lesser of two evils:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing horses in mid-stream (from J2EE to Jini), or
   </li>
<li>Riding a dead horse that wasn't going to get you there anyway (J2EE)
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
This isn't meant to be an indictment of J2EE. Quite the contrary,
J2EE is a fine technology that has its place. But, no technology
is a perfect solution to all problems. Jini happens to provide a
reasonable set of tools for the problems that Countrywide had as
highlighted by this notion found later in the presentation.
</p>
<blockquote>
"We have not yet come across an intergration
problem that cannot be solved using Jini and JDK.
Jini isn't just 'cool', and it <i>is</i>
suitable for enterprise environments. Jini lends itself
to more solutions than J2EE... but is compatible with J2EE."
</blockquote>
<p>
Jini isn't a one-size-fits-all solution any more than J2EE is.
However, the ability to use only those pieces of Jini appropriate
to your problem was also an attractive attribute of Jini technology.
J2EE, somewhat monolithic and indivisible, doesn't provide the same
kind of granularity that a Jini-based service architecture provides.
</p>
<h3>Money on the Table</h3>
<p>
Did you notice something about both of these applications? They
were both dealing with <i>real money</i>. There is money on the
table with both of these applications. Failure of these applications
will result in losses that can be traced directly to the bottom
line. 
</p>
<p>
While there are many metrics that can be employed to assess the
maturity of a technology, here's one that I think is irrefutable:
if folks with use the technology to manage money, it is a mature
technology. To that end, I think the jury is in: Jini has come of age.
