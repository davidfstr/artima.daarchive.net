<b>Summary</b><br/>
Common wisdom, especially in distributed computing, says that the right approach to all problems is to use a standard. This common wisdom has no basis in fact or history, and is curtailing innovation and rewarding bad behavior in our industry.

<p>
<p>We are living in the era of standards. Technology that is a standard is
  good because it is a standard; if something is blessed as a standard it can
  be seen as open, non-proprietary, and gets the blessings of the IT managers
  and the analysts. Something that is not a standard is closed, proprietary,
  and to be avoided at all costs. This is the received wisdom in our
  industry; it is so obviously true that we don't even question it, and we
  seem to get uncomfortable around those who ask why standards should always
  be used.
  

  <p>This kowtowing to the god of standards is, I believe, doing great damage
  to our industry, or craft, and our science. It is stifling innovation. It
  turns technical discussions into political debates. It misunderstands the
  role that standards have played in the past. Worst of all, it is leading us
  down absurd technological paths in the quest to follow standards which have
  never been implemented and aren't the right thing for the problems at hand.

  <p>Let's get back to first principles...standards have historically played
  two roles in our industry. The first role has been to codify what is
  already common practice in the industry. Such standards are attempts to
  capture what everyone is already doing, perhaps ironing out some minor
  inconsistencies along the way. But such a standards effort is at base a
  descriptive one. The original IP standard was such a beast; so was the ANSI
  C standard. Neither attempted to invent much of anything; both simply tried
  to make clear what everyone was already using. The standards being
  described were already <em>de facto</em> standards; writing them down was a
  documentation job that either got it right or missed the mark.

  <p>This is very different from a standards effort that attempts to invent
  the standard from the ground up. Such a standards effort is not
  descriptive, but rather an attempt to invent by committee. There is no
  common practice to describe; instead the standards group is trying to tell
  everyone what they should be doing in the future. The ANSI C++ committee,
  which started out as a descriptive body, became one of these sorts of
  standards groups when it was decided that they should "improve" the
  language. Many of the Object Management Group (OMG) Common Object Request
  Broker Architecture (CORBA) Common Services groups were this sort of
  standards body. There are lots of others around now; I'm sure you can name
  many of them so I won't. These are the <em>de jure</em> standards groups,
  and they are the ruin of our industry.

  <p>Those of you who have been part of a <em>de jure</em> standard effort
  know what I mean when I say that they turn all technical questions into
  political ones. Discussions may appear to center around the technology, but
  the real decisions are made either in setting up the requirements (beware
  the use case, my son) or in meetings outside of the general discussions
  between subsets of the committee who trade votes like Chicago precinct
  bosses. The ultimate threat in such organizations is that some of the
  founding (or important) members will split off and start a competing
  standards group, which seems to be happening on a weekly basis in some of
  these discussions. The real goal in all of this, of course, is to get your
  competitors to (unknowingly) agree to some approach to technology that you
  and your company already have in a product (either shipping or ready to
  go). Then what would otherwise be proprietary can now be seen as an "open"
  standard. Just an open standard that only you have.

  <p>What gets lost in all of this, of course, is whether the technology
  being blessed by the standard actually helps the customer to solve a real
  problem. Can the standard be implemented? Will the implementation perform
  adequately? How much will it cost? All of these sorts of questions are not
  appropriate in the era of <em>de jure</em> standards.

  <p>What is also forgotten in all of this is how fragile the <em>de
  jure</em> standards have been in the past. I can't think of a single
  standard that was invented by committee that has survived in the
  marketplace. The long-standing standards are those that were first <em>de
  facto</em> standards, and were described (no invented) by the standards
  bodies.
  
  <p>Such standards didn't start out in a standards body. They started out
  solving problems. Because they solved the problems, people used them. The
  use drove the standard, not the other way around. This allows innovation,
  this allows technical progress. Things that work get used by people who are
  trying to solve problems. 

  <p>This does take the decision making power out of the hands of the
  managers, and the IT departments, and the technical analysts. They aren't
  trying to solve problems in new ways; they are trying to lead parades, or
  keep their jobs, or show that they have influence. They aren't the
  engineers that can actually understand the solutions, but they do (for the
  most part) understand politics. Standards groups cater to their expertise,
  not the expertise of the engineer.

  <p>Of course, this hard dichotomy is something of a caricature. There are
  substantive discussion of technical merit in standards groups that are
  trying to invent. But that isn't all that goes on. And certainly there is
  little evidence that the best technology wins in such groups. Just look
  around you for evidence of that.

  <p>So the next time you are talking to a manager and he or she tells you
  that you have to use something "because it is a standard", push back. Ask
  why only standards can be used. Ask if the standard has actually been
  implemented, or if the standard will really solve the problem under
  discussion. For that matter, ask if the manager really knows what the
  standard is. If any of these questions can't be clearly answered, may the
  standard isn't the way you should approach your problem.
