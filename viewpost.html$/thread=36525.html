<b>Summary</b><br/>
My take on the debate of whether typing is needed in a language. Rather than taking sides, I revert to my previous incarnation as a philosopher, and try to see what we are really talking about when we seem to be talking about types.

<p>
<p>Everyone seems to be getting their licks in on the subject of whether
      strongly typed languages are a good thing or not. So I thought that I
      would take my turn, and see if maybe this entry could cause a little
      less jerking of the knee and a little more firing of the neurons.

    <p>Like most of you, I have used all kinds of languages with all kinds of
      type systems. I've used weakly typed languages like lisp and
      smalltalk. I've used strongly typed languages where all types are
      checked at compile time like Pascal, C++, and Modula-3. My current
      language of choice is Java, which has lots of compile time checking but
      which also has a dynamic aspect (which I tend to use a lot) that
      sometimes makes it seem like a loosely-typed language. I've even written
      lots of code in COBOL, which has so many other quirks that it is hard to
      tell if it is typed or not.

    <p>I've also heard lots of arguments for and against strong/any
      typing. Types help you avoid errors, but also constrain your ability to
      evolve a program. Types let you see what is going on in the code, but
      they get in the way when you are trying to do rapid prototyping. Types
      give you important structure, but that very structure constrains what
      you can do in a program. I'm sure that there are lots of other
      arguments. I'm sure that I've presented these and others, since I've
      argued on both sides of the issue.

    <p>Quite frankly, I find none of these arguments completely
      convincing. The more I think about the issue, the more I think something
      else is going on here.

    <p>Back when I was studying philosophy, one of my favorite authors was
      John L. Austin, one of the founders of modern linguistic philosophy. One
      of Austin's great insights was that we do a lot more with language than
      simply state facts. We use language for ceremony ("How are you" is not
      necessarily a request for information), we sometimes use language to do
      things (when the minister utters "I now pronounce you man and wife",
      something is done, not claimed to be true or false). Many of the puzzles
      in philosophy, Austin argued, are based on confusing language that is
      doing something different with language that is making a claim about
      some fact about the world.

    <p>I have come to believe that the arguments over typing in a language are
    arguments of this sort. When we argue over whether or not a programming
    language should have types, we are not discussing a matter of
    fact. Instead, we are participating in what Austin would call
    <i>confessional language</i>; what we are really doing is saying something
    about ourselves.

      <p>In particular, I think that those who advocate typed languages are
      (generally) participating in different kinds of programming exercises
      then those who advocate untyped languages. In particular, people who
      argue for strongly typed languages tend to be involved in projects that
      are
    <ul>
<li>large, with lots of interacting components;
      <li>require multiple people to work together;
      <li>will take a long time to develop (weeks or months, not hours); and
      <li>will live for a long time, changing over that time.
    </li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>On the other hand, people who like untyped languages tend to be
      involved in projects that
    <ul>
<li>require lots of prototyping;
      <li>are done by one person, or a small group of people;
      <li>tend to be small or short term; and
      <li>often are used for a short period of time, or are not altered
	through their lifetime.
    </li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Now, before you post the tales of when you used an untyped language for
      a huge project with lots of engineers that lived forever and was
      changing all the time, or the equivalent tales of the small prototyping
      project you did in an afternoon that could only have been done in a
      strongly typed language, remember that my claim is one of tendencies,
      not of absolutes. Before getting all outraged, take a deep breath,
      perhaps a pill (or a drink), and get over it.

    <p>The point I'm getting to is that typing in a language is useful because
      it adds information and constraints to the programs that are written in
      the language. Looking at the signature of a method or function tells you
      more if the method or function is declared in a strongly typed language,
      and you can make more assumptions about the parameters and return values
      in such languages. But this information and these constraints also make
      it harder to do something quickly in those languages, since you have to
      add that extra information and abide by those constraints.

    <p>Which sort of language is best for the task at hand depends very much
      on the task at hand. If the overhead of strong typing (and there is
      considerable overhead) will be paid back over the life of the program by
      the added information and the built-in constraints, then a strongly
      typed language is your tool of choice. When the project is large, and
      involves a lot of people, or lives for a long time, that added
      information and those extra constraints pay off in the long run. But for
      a quick afternoon project, or one in which you are exploring and
      changing the rules as you go, the added information and the constraints
      just get in the way.

    <p>Of course, once you get really proficient with one style of language or
      the other, the overhead involved in changing languages trumps the
      overhead of typing or not. If you are used to a strongly typed language,
      then you think that way even when you are doing rapid prototyping or
      small projects, and the extra overhead is negligible. If you are used to
      working in an untyped language, you are used to filling in the extra
      information (either in comments or just by reading the code) so the
      extra structure seems unnecessary. The end result is that the debate
      become religious. While entertaining, it rarely leads to a conclusion.

    <p>So the next time you find yourself in the typed vs. untyped debate, ask
      yourself if you are really talking about the programming language or
      yourself. You may just be confessing your own history, and the person
      with whom you are arguing is probably doing the same. Given that you are
      both probably right about your pasts, there is really no disagreement,
      and hence there will be no resolution.
