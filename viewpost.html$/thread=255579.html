<b>Summary</b><br/>
Retrospectives allow you to analyze what worked and what didn't about a project so you can do better in the future. How often, though, do people have either the resources or the wherewithall to do a retrospective on a complete disaster -- arguably where we'll learn the most?

<p>I'm reading <a href="../_/http/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922$/ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bruceeckel&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316017922/index.html">Outliers: The Story of Success</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="../_/http/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir$/t=bruceeckel&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0316017922/index.html" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1">
 by Malcom Gladwell, which is yet
another of his <i>the-world-is-not-how-you've-always-thought-it-was</i>
books. I love these kinds of insights not just because it makes the
world fresher with possibility, but because it's possible that, by
destroying some of my assumptions, I might discover a new way of doing
things.

<p>This isn't how I came upon <a href="../_/http/www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/OpenSpaces.html">Open Spaces conferences</a>, for example. The
structure was already there, and we (myself and Martin Fowler -- primarily,
of course, stimulated by Martin's bigger way of thinking about things)
only had to do the experiment. But this was a scary thing to try -- as
anyone who has organized an open spaces event knows, thinking that
everyone is just going to show up and put up interesting discussions
on the board, and that all will go well ... it's an act of faith.

<p>If you take the leap, the result of Open Spaces is nothing short of
magical. It goes against everything you know, and yet it's better than
any conference you've ever experienced.

<p>After doing something like this, you begin to wonder "what other
assumptions am I carrying around, thinking they are hard facts, that
might be disassembled to produce equally astounding (and satisfying)
results?" Which is why I find Gladwell and similar new-thinkers to be
so intriguing. The high concept of <i>Outliers</i> is buried in a
paragraph towards the back of the book: "<i>The world could be so much
richer than the one we have settled for</i>."

<p>In chapter seven (page 184), he makes a fascinating observation
about disasters, in the context of airliner crashes:

<blockquote><i>
The typical accident involves seven consecutive human errors. One of
the pilots does something wrong that by itself is not a problem. Then
one of them makes another error on top of that, which combined with
the first error still does not amount to catastrophe. But then they
make a third error on top of that, and then another and another and
another and another, and it is the combination of all those errors
that leads to disaster.

<p>These seven errors, furthermore, are rarely problems of knowledge
or flying skill. It's not that the pilot has to negotiate some
critical technical maneuver and fails. The kinds of errors that cause
plane crashes are invariably errors of teamwork and communication. One
pilot knows something important and somehow doesn't tell the other
pilot. One pilot does something wrong, and the other pilot doesn't
catch the error. A tricky situation needs to be resolved through a
complex series of steps -- and somehow the pilots fail to coordinate
and miss one of them.
</p></i></blockquote>
<p>Doesn't this sound like software development disasters? Indeed, one of
the maxim's of Gerald Weinberg's <a href="../_/http/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932633013$/ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bruceeckel&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0932633013/index.html">Secrets of Consulting</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="../_/http/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir$/t=bruceeckel&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0932633013/index.html" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" width="1">
 is <i>Things are the way they are because they got
that way ... one logical step at a time</i>. By themselves, each
individual decision seems logical and reasonable, within the small
context in which it was made. Each decision by itself doesn't cause
the disaster. It's the accumulation of errors that does it.

<p>Not just the accumulation of errors, but the lack of review that might
notice that there's a problem. This is a different kind of faith than
the one required to try Open Spaces. This kind of faith says: 

<blockquote><i>
Let's
not waste time looking for problems (that's negative thinking, after
all). Let's just plow forward and hope that, <i>this time</i>,
everything will come out OK all by itself. Even though we have no
historical experience that this can happen, let's just hope that it
will. After all, if it does magically go that way, we'll have saved
all that time and money we would have otherwise wasted doing reviews
and pair programming and any of the other processes designed to
evaluate our work.
</i></blockquote>
<p>When I began writing, I had this same kind of ideal in mind. I would
sit down and the words would just magically flow from my fingertips,
and lay themselves onto the page in wonderful order. I believed, hard,
in the idea of inspired creativity. Moreso, I felt that anything else
was rather corrupt -- if you weren't in the the creative flow, then
there was something wrong with the result.

<p>There are certainly periods of creative flow, and the results
are inspired. Or at least, while you're writing, it seems that
way. After it's rested for awhile and you look at it
again, you find places where it can be improved. With
experience, you discover that everything can always be improved, and
even that it's never that good until you've gone over it a few
times. As many writers are fond of saying "writing is rewriting."

<p>Yet the myth persists of the inspired flow of words: Jack Kerouac
writing "On the Road" in 24 hours. We seem drawn to the
apparently magical overnight successes -- everyone fixates on Bill
Gates doing a quick deal to produce MSDOS and not on all the time and
effort he put in before and after that moment.

<p>That's a fundamental point that Gladwell makes in <i>Outliers</i>: People
who are really good at something, who seem to have "overnight
success," in fact have put in about 10,000 hours of deep immersion in
the topic that has apparently produced this miracle. It's not
a miracle at all, but rather something that has come as a result of a
tremendous amount of focused effort.

<p>I think the problem is that software is infused with magical
properties. Look at what we can create with it -- magical worlds
(games) that make more money than the movie industry (the previous
king of magical worlds). Killer apps that make the creators fortunes,
apparently overnight. This is our mythology, so when we start trying
to build a piece of software, it's natural that we want to assume that
such magic will apply to us (even if, as Gladwell shows, this magic
doesn't exist), and that we don't need to use any silly review
practices. Such (costly, time-consuming) things are for negative
thinkers, not success-oriented go-getters.

<p>An especially damaging aspect of this approach is that review is
not part of the culture of an organization. In the worst cases,
everyone is taught to believe that each piece of code "belongs to" the
person who wrote it, and it's not OK at all to make comments about
other people's work. This is a perfect setup for disaster, because
you'll never know until after the fact that anything is wrong. At
least airline cockpit crews are supposed to make suggestions when
things are going wrong -- if you have a corporate culture that says "each
programmer is an isolated silo" then you'll guarantee that there will
be no clues before or after the project is toppling.

<p>I've <a href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=228097.html">talked
before</a> about the negative characteristics that a team member can
have. Indeed, it's tricky just to put together a neutral team, one
without any toxic characteristics. But even harder is creating a
positive team, and I would say the one feature that determines whether
a team is "positive" is that vague, overused word "communication."
This doesn't mean documentation (although that, done right, is
important), or having meetings or sending out memos. It means the way
that people are able to talk to each other. In short, does pointing
out a potential flaw constitute a disastrous breach of protocol, or is
it just part of a conversation? Gladwell introduces the concept of the
<i>Power-Distance Index</i> (PDI) when talking about plane crashes --
if the cockpit crew comes from a culture where there is a high PDI, it
means that it is very hard for a subordinate to question the pilot or
suggest that something is wrong. This causes accidents.

<p>The knife-edge in the software world is intelligence. In a negative
software culture, the designers and architects are gods who cannot be
questioned -- here we have a high PDI, and questions are seen as
challenges to authority and power, and are thus actively discouraged. The
assumption is that the "leaders" are so smart they don't make mistakes
(an idea promoted by those same "leaders"), and so we don't need to look for
mistakes -- indeed, it's a waste of time and resources to do so.

<p>In a positive software culture with a low PDI, everyone's input is valid.
From the most experienced to the least experienced, everyone makes
mistakes, so the question is not whether mistakes exist, but how do we
discover and minimize them? We know disasters happen so we are on
the lookout to capture and record risk factors. And the leaders put
their effort not into showing how infallible they are, but in
appreciating input that helps them continue to learn and
understand. This culture not only produces software more reliably, it
develops better software engineers and better leaders.

<p>"Communication" in a positive software culture means that everyone
knows that anyone can make a mistake (so it's not a terrible thing)
and anyone kind find a mistake (so it's not a big deal). Most
importantly, there's no way to prevent mistakes; they are just part of
the world of software development. So we can't just hope they don't
happen, we have to actively work with the knowledge that they are
always there. We must track and test against them, and every time we
learn something, everyone on the team learns that thing and we all get
better because of it.

<p>This brings up two important questions:

<ol>
<li>Is it possible to convert a team with a negative software culture
into one with a positive software culture?<br/><br/>
<li>If so, how?
</li></li></ol>
<p>Seven weeks ago I broke my leg skiing. In prior weeks, I had
been thinking that it was time to take another few lessons, to learn
to ski in better control. That is, to get some review and direction in
my skiing style. I <i>knew</i> I was skiing out of control, but it
just seemed like I could go a bit faster, and even a little bit
faster, etc. I had enough control to be able to fly down the mountain
and I seemed to be able to do that and get away with it.

<p>The failure, when it happened, was a series of minor incidents,
ones that I had survived unscathed many times before. But
this time, combined with the fact that I had become used to skiing
slightly out of control, these incidents caused a small disaster that I shall
continue recovering from in weeks to come. Although I was a functional
skier, on my path of slightly-out-of-control behiavior, it was
statistically likely that I would eventually combine the wrong
mistakes and have a disaster. I "only" broke a bone (didn't tear
anything) so I can learn from my mistake without suffering too much
from it.

<p>Do people only change after trauma? The answer seems to be "yes,
mostly." It's also possible to change through inspiration, but that appears
to be the rare exception. Usually you have to get bashed about before
you'll think about changing.

<p>I've had two types of consulting clients. The first, and most
common, appears when something is starting to go wrong, or has already
gone wrong. Project failures seem to go through the "stages of grief"
(hilariously depicted <a href="../_/http/www.youtube.com/watch$/v=XCoaBN6iOu0/index.html">here</a>), usually
getting stuck at "denial." Bringing a consultant into a failing
project is typically either a last-ditch attempt to save the project
(by imagining that the consultant has magical powers) or the beginning
of the process of assigning blame. Neither case is much fun.

<p>But sometimes a client will be smart enough to
understand how bad the odds of success are, and attempt to inject
goodness into the project early on, while there's still a chance of it
making a positive difference. These are the good consulting jobs.

<p>And the very best jobs are when the client has already taken steps
towards success (for example, by choosing a powerful, dynamic language
like Python) and you're brought in to amplify those steps (rather than
trying to motivate them in the first place). This is where the fun
happens. This is where I want to live.

<p>All these questions I keep asking are really the same: "Is change
possible?" The answer, of course, is "Yes... but it's unlikely." Even
the traumatized would prefer to think of it as a bad dream, and to go
back to the way things were, blissfully thinking that everything is
working OK. To quote Weinberg again: "People hate change. They really,
really hate change."

<p>Look at the structure of stories. The main character is pushed out
of their comfort zone by the "inciting incident" (whatever happens to
get the story rolling). But the only logical thing for that
character to do is to try to return to their original comfort
zone. Otherwise the character is unbelievable -- obviously they weren't
comfortable if they didn't try to return to that zone, so why weren't
they already trying to change? Doesn't make sense.

<p>Except in the world, it does. You may hate your cubicle, but you
keep going back to it. If you get kicked out, you try to get back to
it or to another cubicle somewhere else. Cubicles are the devil you
know, and that culture collects other people who are equally willing
to resist change to keep out the uncertainty of the unknown. It's our
nature to keep to certainty, and put up with rather a lot of pain to
do so.

<p>In the face of human propensity towards sameness, how do we
introduce change?

<ol>
<li><b> The change must fit the ability of the team to deal with change.</b>
A consultant that shows up and says "you need to adopt (my favorite
flavor) of Agile" does not fit my definition of a consultant. That's
really more what a trainer does, so the client has already made the
hard decision. But a good trainer figures out how much of the training
the team is ready for. Trying to shove a one-size-fits-all seminar
into a team regardless of what they can handle is a recipe for
unhappiness (I learned this the hard way). It it better to introduce
something small that makes a difference.<br/><br/>
<li><b> The change must be introduced subtly, so as not to engage the
limbic system.</b> Years ago, I took a workshop on <a href="../_/http/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761129235$/ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bruceeckel&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0761129235/index.html">Kaizen
with Robert Maurer</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="../_/http/www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir$/t=bruceeckel&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0761129235/index.html" style="border:none !important;
margin:0px !important;" width="1"/>. This is "personal kaizen" rather
than what you'll normally find about industrial process improvement,
but because of that it seems a better fit for software teams. My
biggest takeaway from the workshop was this: your "primitive brain" is
easily frightened and always scanning for changes (Maurer used the
example of monkeys fleeing for the trees when a leopard jumps
out). The main trick of "personal kaizen" is to introduce changes that
are so un-threatening that your primitive brain laughs. For example, I
was having trouble flossing. Saying "I'm going to floss three times a
day" was a big, frightening change, so the primitive brain goes into
flight mode. But I could safely commit to "I'm going to floss once a
month" without causing any reaction (the dentist in our group was
thrilled). And each time I did floss, it turned out not to be such a
big deal, so over time I became a much more frequent flosser.<br/><br/>
<li><b> The force for change must be steady, to overcome the natural
tendency to return to the original resting state.</b> As noted
earlier, our impulse when disturbed is to return to our comfort zone
(even if it's not really comfortable, but only familiar). So if a
consultant shows up and introduces a new technique and then leaves, it
seems interesting in theory "but we have work to do" and so it's just
too easy to return to what you always do. Even if the consultant helps
you restructure your project for the new technique, the minute there's
some pressure and you don't know what to do, you'll fall back into
your old ways. Some consulting firms solve this by providing
consultants nonstop for the duration of the project -- while probably
effective, this seems like expensive overkill (and a common pattern
seems to start with primary consultants, later substituted with
secondary consultants at the same fee). A more moderate and
economic solution is repeated consulting visits to provide regular
course corrections. This has the added benefit that you're more likely
to be able to work with the same primary consultant for each visit,
which provides better continuity.<br/><br/>
