<p>
I've been doing some thinking about objects recently, perhaps brought on
    by my agreeing to do a talk at the <a href="../_/http/www.jini.org/meetings/eighth/index.html">8th Jini Community
      Meeting</a> on this subject. Of course, it does one good to
    think hard about things that you have taken for granted for some time;
    this is one of the reasons that I went back to Sun Labs some time ago, and
    why I read <em>The Mythical Man Month</em> every couple of years, and
    why I read Socrates' <em>Apology</em> at least as often. I, at least, need
    to be reminded about the basics every now and then, and think about what I
    do without thinking about it.<p>

      I imagine that most of the readers of this blog would claim to believe
      in objects (this may be true by vacuous quantification). But what does
      it mean to believe in objects? This has lead to a lot of reflection over
      the past couple of months, but in this post I want to be a little more
      focused. In particular, I want to ask the question of whether objects
      are something that we can believe in without believing in the objects of
      a particular kind expressed in a particular language, or if there is
      something more abstract about objects.<p>

      In some sense, objects are simply a way of abstracting information by
      joining the underlying state of the information with the code that
      manipulates the information. I've often said that objects are a
      combination of data and code, and in some abstract way that is true. But
      getting more detailed than this generally starts tying one to the
      language in which we are expressing objects.<p>

      For example, it is very rare that an object really is a combination of
      state and code; far more common is that an object is a combination of
      state and a class descriptor, with the class descriptor (often with some
      other form of information) pointing off to some code. There are
      non-class-based object-oriented languages (like <a href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_programming_language/index.html">Self</a>) that don't have a notion of sharing code among a group of objects, but they are in the minority. <p>

      Once the notion of a class has been introduced, there are notions of the
      relationship between classes, often stated in terms of inheritance and
      often (but not always) associated with a type system. Different
      languages allow different kinds of associations to be built between
      classes and types. All these different ways of associating classes have
      an impact on the way in which the state and the code that we think of as
      making up the object are actually related. And then there are things
      like the Java language notion of a classloader, which adds another level
      of indirection between the state of an object and the actual code that
      is associated with the object.<p>

      This difference between our (or, at least, my) mental model of an object
      and the actual expression of an object in a computing system has all
      sorts of interesting effects. The only one I plan on talking about here
      is that an object in one language is generally very different from an
      object in a different language, because of all of the various ways in
      which different decisions made in the language design are reflected in
      the way the objects in that language are put together.<p>

      For example, consider an object in the Java environment and an object in
      C++. There are lots of surface similarities. But C++ allows multiple
      class inheritance, while Java does not. C++ has operator overloading,
      the Java language (whew!) does not. C++ objects have destructors,
      Java objects have finalizers; while these appear similar on the surface
      they are really very different. The list could go on.<p>

      Now, in what sense are Java objects the same as C++ objects? There is
      the conceptual similarities (both are abstractions of state, allowing
      polymorphic typing, etc.) but they are very hard to translate from one
      idiom to the other. This is something that becomes most clear when one
      gets asked (generally by a manager) to "translate" a program written in
      C++ into the Java language. Even though these two languages are both
      concerned with objects, there is no real sense in which one can
      translate a program written in one into a program written in the other;
      at best one can write a new program that does the same things in the new
      language. But this isn't translation, this is writing a new program.<p>

      In some ways, this feels similar to the situation with basic data types
      some time ago. When I started programming, a C <code>int</code> was not
      the same as a Pascal <code>INTEGER</code> and neither was anything like a
      COBOL <code>PIC 9(5)</code>. In fact, at that time a C <code>int</code>
      on one machine and compiler might not be the same as a C
      <code>int</code> on a different machine or compiler. It took a lot of
      work to get the notion of common data types to work across programs.<p>

      Similar work has not been done in the area of objects. There has been
      some noise that an environment is both object-oriented and
      language-independent, but to my knowledge all such environments are
      object-oriented only in the entities that you can send messages to
      (either directly or across the network). The arguments and return values
      of those objects need to be restricted to a small number of basic data
      types. This is hardly allowing first-class objects in a
      language-independent way.<p>

      So the question that has been nagging me for the last while is simply
      this: is there a notion of object which is independent of the language
      in which one is programming? If so, I haven't come across it yet. If
      not, then do we have to make a choice in our work between objects and
      language-independence? I'm beginning to think that the second of these
      is the more viable approach, but it flies in the face of much of what we
      have been taught in software development.But perhaps that should be left
      as a topic for another day.<p>
