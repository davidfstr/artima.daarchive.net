LongPause.  Deep  breath. Story resumes.  Well, yes, it’s  been a busy few months in the small, mobile devices field, what with being up  to the eyebrows in day-in, day-out, day-job kinds of things.  All work, work, work, with smart people and  smart little devices from eight time zones and four continents ( if you count  the sub continents, which I don’t have any idea why you wouldn’t, since a couple  of billion people live there).  And this  brings me to my point (I <em>do</em> have  one…). I’ve been hit—<em>flattened,</em> if  you will-- by a great big epiphany, and it is this:  Almost everyone in this business (including  me) has been asking the wrong questions up to now.  We’ve been making foot prints in the sand, plodding  through the trackless wasteland that is mobile device content development (only  a slight exaggeration) trying to find elegant routes to cross-platform code  portability, app reliability and security validation, distribution channel  access, and profitable mobile content publishing business models.  It is fair to say there is no freeway to  these destinations.  In fact, the pretty  good <em>trails</em> don’t even stay in place  for long, given shifting economic winds, every variety of technical  fragmentation, and the unsettled nature of mobile device ecology.  So. What we’ve all been pursuing, without a  huge amount of success, is a solid set of “Hows”.  And the reason “How” is so incredibly elusive  in this space? We’ve skipped a really important prerequisite: Understanding “Why”.<a href="https://dafoster.net/projects/crystal-web-archiver/" id="cr-footer-banner" style="border-top: 2px #B40010 solid;background: #FFFAE1;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif;font-variant: initial;font-weight: initial;text-transform: none;font-size: 14px;color: #6c757d;line-height: 2.0;cursor: pointer;display: flex;align-items: center;justify-content: center;gap: 4px;clear: both;" target="_blank"><img height="24" onerror="this.style['display'] = 'none';" src="../_/crystal/resources/appicon.png" width="24"/><span>This page was archived with Crystal</span><script>window.addEventListener('load', function() { const $1 = document.querySelector('#cr-footer-banner'); if (!$1) { return; } if (window !== window.top) { let $2 = false; if (window.name) { const $3 = window.parent.document.getElementsByName(window.name); if ($3.length === 1) { const $4 = $3[0]; if ($4.tagName === 'FRAME' && $4.parentElement.tagName === 'FRAMESET') { let $5 = $4; while (true) { if ($5.parentElement.tagName !== 'FRAMESET') { $2 = true; break; } if ($5.parentElement.attributes['rows'] !== undefined) { const $6 = $5.parentElement.children; if ($5 === $6[$6.length - 1]) { $5 = $5.parentElement; continue; } else { break; } } else if ($5.parentElement.attributes['cols'] !== undefined) { const $7 = Array.from($5.parentElement.children); const $8 = $7.indexOf($5); if ($8 === -1) { break; } const $9 = $5.parentElement.attributes['cols'].value.split(','); const $10 = $9.map((s) => parseInt(s.trim())); if ($9[$8].trim() === '*' || $10[$8] === Math.max.apply(null, $10)) { $5 = $5.parentElement; continue; } else { break; } } else { break; } } } } } if (!$2) { $1.style['display'] = 'none'; } } const $11 = $1.getBoundingClientRect(); const $12 = ($11.y < window.innerHeight - $11.height); if ($12) { $1.style['position'] = 'fixed'; $1.style['bottom'] = '0'; $1.style['left'] = '0'; $1.style['right'] = '0'; $1.style['z-index'] = '9999'; } const $13 = ( document.body.getBoundingClientRect().height < $11.height * 2 ); if ($13) { $1.style['display'] = 'none'; }

  And here’s the diagnostic symptom of this syndrome: Virtually  without current exception, everyone sitting on a cash war chest in the mobile content  development space is trying to figure out how to shoehorn an Internet browser  experience onto small mobile devices (both smartphones and the mobile internet  devices variously called MIDs, UMPCs or SCCs). Similar to, say... a subprime  mortgage crisis, this catastrophe began with eminently pragmatic, bottom-line  motivations. Using existing browser based content to make a quick port and a  quick profit is tempting.  After all, it’s  apparently a wide open door to an emergent global market which, according to  even the gloomiest forecasts, will run to 100s of millions of units within the  next 36 months. And it’s pretty important to get there.  Last year smartphones outsold PCs by 4 to 1,  so the writing is not just on the wall, it’s on the wall in about <em>seventeen</em> languages. But like so much in  life, running at a thing and grabbing with both hands isn’t usually the best  way to get it.</br></p>
<p>  <br/>
  At the risk of stripping the metaphorical gears here, there  are patterns about archetypes and outcomes that could easily apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ugly stepsister couldn’t fit into glass slipper.</li>
<li>Ignoring beautiful but unconventional Cinderella  only postpones truly appropriate match. </li>
</ul>
<p>Or, extrapolating to Browser-on-Phone: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>It</em> <em>doesn’t fit because it is  too big; </em></li>
<li><em>It</em> <em>never will fit no matter  how much we shove; </em></li>
<li><em>And we’re darn lucky it doesn’t fit, because this is about  as dysfunctional a relationship as you’ll get without calling in Nora Ephron to  write the script.</em>. </li>
</ul>
<p> <br/>
  We won’t get a connected mobile culture simply by leveraging  existing laptop or notebook targeting code—not as whole apps, or even as whole  concepts.</p>
<p><br/>
<strong>Start  By Asking the Right Questions</strong><br/>
  As every curious person knows, there are two fundamental  elements to productive experimentation: First, ask the right questions; And  second, recognize the answer when you find it, even if it turns up under the  bed or behind the door.  What does this  mean? Here’s an instructive technology tale, and a true one: </p>
<p><br/>
  One day in 1970, Spencer Silver was toiling away in the  bowels of 3M Labs attempting to create a super-strong adhesive.  A really, really, super strong adhesive--one  that would be powerful enough to, say, glue the rings of Saturn together--when  he discovered…a super weak adhesive.   Unfortunately, it barely qualified as an adhesive at all.  It made things stick to one another, but they  easily peeled apart.  In fact, it almost  entirely lacked that wonderful quality everyone so appreciates in an adhesive:  adhesion.  Oh, well.  That’s the beauty of being a salaried  research chemist.  You get to fail a lot  of times, and no one minds much.  <em>Fast forward <strong>four years</strong></em>. While singing in his church choir, Arthur Fry, one  of Silver’s 3M colleagues, was frequently embarrassed by the fact that the  bookmarks kept falling out of his hymnal, causing him to come in late on nearly  every tune, as he frantically searched for the correct page.  In a moment of sheer exasperation (his and  the choir director’s) Fry remembered Silver’s lousy adhesive, and thought it  would be just the thing to keep those pesky bookmarks planted where he wanted  them.  Three things came of this insight:  1) Fry managed to sing the right hymns and come in with the rest of the  basses.  2) The choir director presumably  lived a longer and happier life than would otherwise have been the case.  3) 3M sold $100 million dollars worth of Post  It Notes, which remain the fifth largest selling office supply item in the  world.</p>
<p><br/>
  Now for the analogy that links smartphones and MIDs and UMPCs  to Post It Notes.  Undiscerning translations  of laptop and desktop user interaction patterns to these platforms is probably the  biggest opportunity to miss an opportunity out there today. It’s the wrong  match of problem and solution and has the potential to be an appalling waste of  time.  So let’s get to the right  questions, and without further delay. For starters what does <em>mobile</em> mean,  anyway? If “mobile” means “talk or text from where ever”, then why isn’t a low  end phone good enough and what doesn’t it do? But if “mobile” means  ultra-portable access to big computing iron and heavy lifting client/server  functionality, why isn’t a notebook good enough, and what doesn’t <em>it</em> do? Forget what people <em>can</em> do with small devices.  What <em>are</em> they doing? And where, how often? It’s fair to say that no one has accurately  or completely answered these questions, either in the technical sense or in the  matter of articulating a technology consumer worldview. This is largely why we  have such extraordinary, and extraordinarily durable, fragmentation in this  space.  </p>
<p><strong>The  Five Senses Approximation and Flatness</strong></p>
<p><br/>
  Clearly, the first step on the path to intelligent  innovation in the mobile space is to acknowledge that we need to <em>start</em> innovating, which is pretty much  the polar opposite of dragging every desktop idea we’ve had since 1979 along  and trying to squeeze the mindgrapes out of it until it fits on a two inch  screen. Which is not to say there has been no success, just that we haven’t  coherently integrated it into something   that allows users –lots of them, in lots of places—to react to small  devices like this: “Uh huh.  That makes  perfect sense.  That’s just how I want to  do what I need done.” And, needless to say, I am pondering this, a lot. SO. Here’s  the accumulated body of experimental data from what I’ve seen, done and worked  on in the last eight months:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile  devices can be the “five senses”, vastly enriching life for people by enabling  a much more emotive, immediate, nuanced human/device partnership than anything  we’ve had to work with before</strong>.  With  their cameras, they can “see”, with touch screens, they can “feel”,  with their microphones they can “hear”, with  their speakers they can “talk”, with their GPS function they can orient  themselves in the world and with their accelerometers they can orient  themselves in space. Which is pretty close to having a really good dog, but  without the lawn problems.</li>
<li><strong>Blink  time: For most people, 2 to 6 seconds.  So  that’s how long you have to offer an actionable result on a mobile device.</strong>  <em>Because  of the small size of device screens, the human mind is wired to believe it  should be able to see, analyze and store the information displayed there in one  blink cycle</em>.  And there you have the  cognitive explanation for why it is far more annoying to get a slow response from a small device than when a big screen is exactly as  sluggish.  <strong><em>Which makes it mandatory for  small device UI hierarchies to be very, very flat</em></strong>.  Surprise!   The Luddites were right!! Sort of. As it turns out, cognitively,  “flatness” is wired into the human brain right next door to “Uh-huh”.  Evolution really liked it when we knew where  we were, and how to get to the next stop without running into a lot of higher  order participants in the food chain.  </li>
</ul>
<p>So if you think at all about this stuff—and I do, all of the  time-- here are a couple of places I’ve seen recently where something is going  really, really right:</p>
