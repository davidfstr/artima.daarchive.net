<b>Summary</b><br/>
Software engineering is a lot less like other kinds of engineering than most of us would like to think. There is an aspect of art to what we do, that is learned not in school but by finding a master and serving an apprenticeship.

<p>
<p>It's been over a month since I last posted, a break explained by the
  intervention of JavaOne and the experience of being <i>Slashdotted</i> on my
  last installment. But July is here, so it is time to declare independence
  once again and post some thoughts.

  <p>During the last couple of weeks, I've been reading a number of articles
  by <a href="../_/http/www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a> on the connection
  between programming and art and the similarities in different kinds of
  things that we call <i>design</i>. I like a lot of what Graham has to say
  (and agree with some of it as well), and while he sometimes takes a long
  time to say it (at least for a web publication), it is because his points
  are complex rather than because his writing is long-winded. I highly
  recommend the site, both for its look and its content, especially his
  articles on what it is to develop software.

  <p>Software development is an odd sort of activity. While we in the industry
  talk about being engineers, it is engineering of a rather odd sort. The body
  of established science that you need to know to become a software engineer
  is rather small, and there are a number of very good software developers who
  have never formally studied the field at all. I consider myself at least a
  competent software designer. But my own formal training was in philosophy
  (as it turns out is also the case with Paul Graham), and about a third of
  those with whom I went to graduate school are now designing software. And
  nearly all of us made the switch with little or no formal training in
  software engineering or computer science.

  <p>While it is less common now than it was when I started in the field (low
  those many years ago), there are a surprising number of excellent software
  developers and designers whose background is in subjects such as
  mathematics, or music, or anthropology, or a number of other disciplines
  that are not thought of as engineering. While I don't think that it is
  impossible, I would bet there are very few people who switched from, say,
  philosophy or music to, say, mechanical or electrical engineering
  without any additional formal education. This is certainly less true
  now than it was 20 or so years ago when I started; I doubt that I could
  find the positions now that I was able to find then that allowed me to make
  the switch. But the fact that it was possible until fairly recently says
  something, I think, about the nature of software production.

  <p>One possible explanation is that software engineering is a fairly new
  field. There isn't a large body of knowledge that one needs to master to
  become a software engineer; you can start doing reasonable (and useful) work
  while picking up that knowledge. The same may have been true in the past of
  other forms of engineering, but now those fields have matured to a point
  where there is a lot of accumulated knowledge that is best learned as part
  of a formal education. But I think that the real reason is somewhat
  different than the youth of the subject; I think the real reason is that
  software engineering isn't like other forms of engineering so much as it is
  like a craft or an art form, both activities that can be learned by
  apprenticeships rather than formal education.

  <p>The notion of an apprenticeship is rarely talked about by the human
  resources types (although the newest incarnation of the idea, that of
  mentoring, is becoming pretty respectable), but it is a pretty standard way
  of getting your real training in software development. Ask most any good
  software developer who he or she served an apprenticeship with, and they
  will start telling stories of the master craftsman from whom they learned
  their art. Most won't even find the question odd, or ask for an
  explanation. How else could we have learned what we do?

  <p>This is even (or perhaps especially) true of those who have had formal
  education in software engineering. I've often told university professors
  that people coming straight out of school are mostly useless for at least
  six months when they enter my groups, and that it takes them about a year
  to become really useful. This is true for those with master's degrees and
  with bachelors (don't even ask me about Ph.D.s). And it shouldn't be
  surprising...after all, the sort of software development that is done in a
  university setting is very different than the sort of development (and
  maintenance) done in an industrial setting. Learning the latter takes more
  than a course; it takes practice, and the accumulated practice of someone
  (or someones) who have done it long enough and successfully enough to have
  an idea of the craft involved.

  <p>Of course, another reason that there is no good way to teach a class that
  will train people in the aspects of design and software development that are
  learned during an apprenticeship is that there is no single method that is
  right. There are many ways of doing good software development and design,
  just as there are many ways of doing those things badly. Some good
  designers will work long and hard on a specification before any code is
  written, trying to figure out all of the structure of a system before
  changing that structure becomes difficult. Others will do lots of
  prototypes, iterating over the code until the structure of the overall
  design becomes clear. Others do some combination of these two approaches;
  I'm sure that there are others that do something entirely different. The
  designs that result from these different approaches are not better or worse
  than those that result from some other way of coming at the problem. But
  they are different.

  <p>All of this was studied by <a href="../_/http/www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/index.html">Fred
  Brooks</a>, author of the classic <b>Mythical Man Month</b> and Turing
  Award winner; the results of his study led to his papers on the design of
  design. His conclusion, which surprises few good software engineers but
  dismays many in management, is that good design comes from good designers,
  not from some process. This may dismay many managers because it means that
  the engineers they employ are not interchangeable parts that can be insured
  to give good results by the application of the <i>right</i> process. But it
  is the truth, and they need to deal with it, as do those who want to take
  the individual out of design by having a more (supposedly) rigorous set of
  rules for software engineering.

  <p>A corollary of the Brooks conclusion that good design comes from good
  designers is that good designers receive their training from other good
  designers. This training happens during the apprenticeship, when attempts
  at design are reviewed and criticized, when code is read, or during
  conversations over the lunch table. It generally doesn't happen in a
  classroom (although the master craftsman may be a teacher, who does the
  training during reviews, readings, and lunches). And, much like working
  with a Zen master, it happens at different times and in different ways for
  different people. Someone who is a good master for one person learning the
  craft may be just wrong for another.

  <p>The point of all this, if there is one, is that those who want to reduce
  software engineering (by which I mean the designing and producing of
  high-quality software systems) to a set of rules and procedures that can be
  followed by anyone to get consistently good results simply don't understand
  the field. Yes, there are processes which can help in the production of
  good software (any group that doesn't have a good way of doing code reviews
  is fooling itself if it claims to be producing quality software). But while
  lack of such processes can insure the production of bad software, having
  such processes does not insure the production of good software. For that
  something extra is needed, which is the craft and aesthetics that result
  from training with a master in the art.

  <p>In this way, what we call software engineering is really more like
  architecture (real architecture that produces buildings) than it is like
  other kinds of engineering. There is an element of science (a building has
  to obey the laws of physics) but there is also a large element of
  art. Depending on what kind of software you produce, the mix of the two may
  differ some, but there is always a mix. Much of the science can be taught
  in schools, but the art can only be learned by practice and can be produced
  in many ways. Those who are looking for the one true way to do the art
  don't understand what it is we produce, or wish that what they understand
  can be replaced by something more "scientific." It can't, so they should
  just get over it.

  <p>And, I might add, it is a good thing that what we do requires both art
  and science. That is what makes it so much fun...
