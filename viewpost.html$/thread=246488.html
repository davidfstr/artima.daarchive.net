<p>As you may know, for some time I have been running a campaign against
multiple inheritance and mixins - you may want to read the
conclusion of the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/forums/flat.html$/forum=106&amp;thread=237121.html">third article</a> of the series
<em>Things to Know About Super</em> and
<a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=246341.html">the first</a> and <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=246483.html">the second</a> article of the series
<em>Mixins considered harmful</em>.
Following that route, last week I decided to
release a module I wrote this summer, the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/pypi.python.org/pypi/strait/index.html">strait</a> module, which
implements traits for Python.</p>
<p>The implementation is inspired by the 2003
paper <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.iam.unibe.ch/%7Escg/Archive/Papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf">Traits - Composable Units of Behavior</a>. Traits are
simple since they cannot have common methods and the method
resolution order is trivial. There is an implementation of the concept
in the Smalltalk implementation <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.squeak.org/index.html">Squeak</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference" href="../_/http/pypi.python.org/pypi/strait/index.html">strait</a> module was written as a design exercise, to prove a few points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>that you can replace multiple inheritance with a less powerful but also
simpler and less dangerous mechanism, without losing much
expressive power;</li>
<li>that a language such as Python is powerful enough that you can implement
traits in 100 lines by using single inheritance only;</li>
<li>that you can keep a kind of method cooperation even using traits,
but in a simpler way than using multiple inheritance, basically
by setting straight the original hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The documentation of the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/pypi.python.org/pypi/strait/index.html">strait</a> module is intended for language designers,
framework writers and advanced Python programmers. It actually was
written for the guys of the python-dev list, as a companion to
a <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/dev/673833/index.html">thread about my articles on super</a>. It is not intended for
the average Joe programmer, and it is somewhat technical, focusing
on the details on the Python implementation. On the other hand,
knowing that alternatives to multiple inheritance and mixins exist
in my opinion is good for everybody.</p>
<p>Thus, I have decided to supplement the documentation of the strait
module with a few notes explaining what traits are, the differences
with multiple inheritance and mixins and what we mean by method
cooperation.  The notes here are intended for any programmer with
experience in OOP, and they are not Python specific at all.</p>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="multiple-inheritance-and-method-cooperation" name="multiple-inheritance-and-method-cooperation">Multiple inheritance and method cooperation</a></h1>
<p><a class="reference" href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance/index.html">Multiple inheritance</a>, <a class="reference" href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixins/index.html">mixins</a> and <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.iam.unibe.ch/%7Escg/Archive/Papers/Scha03aTraits.pdf">traits</a> are usually considered
advanced techniques of object oriented programming, since the most
popular languages (Java, C#, VisualBasic, PHP) do not support them, or
support them in a poor way (C++).  On the other hand, those techniques
are pretty common in the coolest languages out there, such as Python
(featuring multiple inheritance), Ruby (featuring mixins) and Scala
(featuring "traits").  I am quoting the term "traits" when referred to
Scala, since Scala traits are more similar to Python mixins
than to Squeak traits. Actually, Scala traits can be composed when
they override the same method and the order of the composition
determines the resulting pattern of super calls: that means that Scala
traits have basically all the complications of Python mixins, which
I would rather avoid.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance is the most general technique among the three
cited before: mixins can be seen as a restricted form of multiple
inheritance and traits as a restricted form of mixins.
Multiple inheritance is available in various languages, such as
C++, Common Lisp, Python, Eiffel, and others.
In a multiple inheritance language, a class can have more than one parent
and thus can inherit methods and attributes from more sources at
the same time. Maintaining code taking advantages of
(multiple) inheritance is nontrivial, since in order to understand how
a class works, one needs to study all of its parents (and the parents
of the parents, recursively).</p>
<p>That means that there is a strong coupling of the code:
changing any method in any
ancestors has an effect on the class. To some extent this
is is inevitable, since the other face of code reuse if code coupling
(you cannot have one without the other) and one has to cope with that.
Also, you have the same problem
even with single inheritance, when you have a deep hierarchy.
However, multiple inheritances adds another level of complication.</p>
<p>For instance, the order of the parents
is significant: a class <em>C1</em> inheriting from <em>P1</em> and <em>P2</em> does
not necessarily behave the same as a class <em>C2</em> inheriting from <em>P2</em> and
<em>P1</em> where the order of the parents is inverted.
The reason is that for common methods, i.e. methods with the same name,
the methods of <em>P1</em> have the precedence over the
methods of <em>P2</em> for the class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C1(P1,</span> <span class="pre">P2)</span></tt>, but not
for the class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C2(P2,</span> <span class="pre">P1)</span></tt>.
Since the common methods are silently overridden and programmers are not
quite good at remembering the ordering, that may give raise to subtle bugs.</p>
<p>The situation is worse if one looks at the higher order ancestors:
the order of overriding (the so called MRO, Method
Resolution Order) is definitely non trivial:
I actually wrote a long essay on the subject, describing
the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/index.html">Python MRO</a> and I refer to that reference for the details.
While that reference is Python specific, the concept of method
resolution (also called <em>linearization</em> in the Lisp world) is
general and applies to many languages, including Dylan and Common
Lisp.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the linearizations
of Dylan and Common Lisp, you should look at <a class="reference" href="../_/http/192.220.96.201/dylan/linearization-oopsla96.html">this paper</a>. On the other
hand, if you are a reader of my <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=238789.html">Scheme series</a> or a Scheme practitioner,
I suggest you to read the
paper <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.cs.utah.edu/plt/publications/aplas06-fff.pdf">Scheme with Classes, Mixins, and Traits</a>, which describes
the object system of PLT Scheme, which support both cooperative
mixins and traits in the Squeak sense.</p>
<p>Scala does not support full multiple inheritance, but its traits
are nearly as powerful (the only difference between a trait and a
regular class is that the trait does not define a constructor)
and nearly as complicated, therefore I would consider Scala in
the same class with Python and Common Lisp. If you
want to look at how Scala works, you may look the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaOverview.pdf">Scala Overview</a>
paper. Theoretically, the Python MRO is the best one,
since it is monotonic, but in practice all MROs are quite complicated.</p>
<p>The point to notice is that the complication of the MRO is by design:
languages with a non-trivial MRO where <em>designed</em> this way
to make possible <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/#cooperation/index.html">method cooperation via super calls</a>. That means
that if both parents <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P1</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P2</span></tt> define a method <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></tt>,
a child class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C</span></tt> can override it and still have access to
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">m</span></tt> methods of the parents via <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt>: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C.m</span></tt> will
call first <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P1.m</span></tt> and then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P2.m</span></tt>, if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">P1.m</span></tt> features
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt> call itself.</p>
<p>Of course, this
is just one possible design: different languages may adopt different
designs. For instance the Eiffel language implements multiple
inheritance, but it raises an exception when two methods with
the same name are present: the programmer is forced to specify an
explicit renaming (this is basically what happens for traits).</p>
<p>Years ago, I thought such a design to be simplistic (even stupid) and
very much inferior to the Python cooperative design: nowadays I have
had more experience with real life large object oriented systems using
multiple inheritance and I have come to appreciate "stupid"
designs. Actually, nowadays I think Smalltalk made the right choice
thirty years ago, deciding to <em>not</em> support multiple inheritance nor
mixins.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="mixins-and-traits-without-multiple-inheritance" name="mixins-and-traits-without-multiple-inheritance">Mixins and traits without multiple inheritance</a></h1>
<p>In practice, the overriding problem is not very frequent (it is serious
when it happens, but it <em>rarely</em> happens) since usually frameworks are
designed to mix <em>independent</em> sets of functionality. Usually one does
not need the full power of multiple inheritance: mixins or traits are
powerful enough to implement most frameworks.</p>
<p>In a language with multiple inheritance it is natural
to implement mixins as classes.
However, this is not the only solution. In general, we can speak
of mixin programming in any language where it is possible to inject
methods in the namespace of a class, both statically before class creation
or dynamically after class creation.</p>
<p>For instance,
Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, bit it does support mixins
since it is possible to include methods coming from a module:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class C_with_mixin &lt; C:
   include M # M is a module
</pre>
<p>There is an advantage in this approach: modules have no parents and
there is no concept of method resolution order, so it is much easier
to figure out what a mixin does, as compared to figure out what
a mixin implemented as a class in a multiple inheritance hierarchy
does. On the other hand, there is no method cooperation in the sense
of Python or Scala <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt> or CLOS <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">call-next-method</span></tt>.
There is a limited
cooperation between parent and sons only, since Ruby <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt>
(like Java <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt>), is able to dispatch to the parent
class only.
This is not
necessarily a bad thing, though.</p>
<p>Ruby mixins are much simpler than Scala traits or Python mixins,
but they still suffer for the ordering problem: mixing the module <em>M1</em> and the
module <em>M2</em> is different than mixing the module <em>M2</em>
and the module <em>M1</em>: if the modules contain methods with
the same name, changing the composition order affects the
resulting class.</p>
<p>Traits were invented just to solve this problem: common methods
raise an error unless the programmer specifies the precedence
explicitly, or she renames the methods. After that, traits commute.
Traits are therefore the most explicit and safest technique,
whereas multiple inheritance is the most fragile technique,
with mixins in between.</p>
<p>A proper implementation of traits should also include introspection
tools such that a class can be seen both as a flat collection of
methods and as a composite entity (the original paper about traits
explain this point pretty well). That should help with the namespace
pollution problem by giving to the developer the ability to see the
class as a composition of traits (one could argue that in Python pydoc
allows you to see the origin of the methods as coming from parent
classes, but that support is insufficient to manage situations with
complicate inheritance hierarchies and lots of methods).</p>
<p>In Python you can also implement mixins without inheritance simply by
dynamically adding methods to a class, starting from a method dictionary
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">M</span></tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
class C_with_mixin(C):
   pass

for name in M: # M is a dictionary of methods
   setattr(C_with_mixin, name, M[name])
</pre>
<p>Implementing Ruby mixins in Python is therefore trivial, you can
just read the methods from a module dictionary. Implementing
traits is a bit less trivial, since you must check for common
names and raise an error in that case. Moreover you must be
careful with ordering issues: the traits paper says that
methods coming from a trait must take the precedence over
methods coming from the base class, but they must <em>not</em> take
the precedence over methods defined in the class.</p>
<p>I took some liberty with my own implementation of traits,
which was just <em>inspired</em> by the Squeak implementation, but
it is not the same. In particular, I added some support
for cooperation of traits, i.e. there is a kind of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt>,
but its functionality is limited with respect to the regular
super, and it is a bit more akward to use: this is on purpose,
to discourage designs based on method cooperation, which I
think are fragile and not to be recommended (again, see the
<a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/forums/flat.html$/forum=106&amp;thread=237121.html">third article</a> on my series about <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">super</span></tt>).
Still, in the
very few special case where one wants cooperation, that is
possible indeed.</p>
<p>All those points are explained in the documentation of the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/pypi.python.org/pypi/strait/index.html">strait</a> module,
so you should look there, if you are really interested in the subject.
Here I will just add that I still prefer <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=237764.html">generic functions</a> to traits.
Nevertheless, traits may have a role if you want to follow the traditional
route of having methods inside classes, and they are a smaller leap
from traditional object oriented programming. Moreover, it is much
easier to convert a pre-existing framework from using mixins to
using traits than to convert it generic functions.</p>
<p>If you want to play with traits in Python, you are welcome to try the
<a class="reference" href="../_/http/pypi.python.org/pypi/strait/index.html">strait</a> module. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Post scriptum</em>. I realize that this post may be misinterpreted, so
let me make clear a couple of points:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I am <em>not</em> asking for removing multiple inheritance in Python and
replacing it with traits. However, I am saying to people writing
new languages: <em>think twice before adding multiple inheritance</em>.
Certainly it is more <a class="reference" href="../_/http/sayspy.blogspot.com/2007/04/five-1-things-i-hate-about-python-and.html">difficult to implement</a> than traits; moreover,
I am arguing that it makes life more difficult for yours users too.</li>
<li>I do <em>not</em> think traits are the best thing after sliced bread. They
are a bit better than multiple inheritance, but I still recommend
to keep things simple and to use both (single) inheritance and
traits as little as possible.</li>
</ol>
