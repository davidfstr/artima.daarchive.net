"What is the best UML tool?"
<br/>
"A white board marker."
</blockquote>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<i>Guerrilla Development</i> is software development in an environment 
unsupportive of the effort. In my first few essays I discussed some of
the problems software departments might have in their interactions with 
the rest of the company. These included stonewalling product managers,
poor-planning upper managers, and even hostile engineers in related
departments or disciplines. Software engineering discussions in books,
magazines, and user groups tend to apportion too much blame on the
software department when things don't go smoothly. I believe that there
is plenty of blame to go around.
</p>
<p>
That said, I agree that some of our problems are self-inflicted. Other
problems might be better categorized as <i>missed opportunities</i>. In this
essay, I'll discuss one such missed opportunity and articulate some of
my worries for the future of UML.
</p>
<h2>The Future of UML</h2>
<p>
The reactions that I get from many engineers when I broach the topic
of UML leads me to believe that they think the whole thing is a 
conspiracy foisted upon the software community by the tool vendors
in their endless search for more suckers. If that notion prevails,
I'm certain that we will have lost out on something important.
</p>
<p>
UML can be a fabulous tool for helping engineers communicate ideas.
The power of UML isn't the fact that it is drawn with boxes and
arrows but that the specific shapes of things and the types of 
arrows have some agreed upon meaning. If two engineers know something
about, say, class diagrams in UML and one of them begins drawing a 
class hierarchy, the other immediately knows which class inherits from
the other. There is nothing <i>magic</i> about the boxes or arrows;
it is just a set of agreed upon conventions that allows engineers who
share the knowledge of those conventions to communicate quickly and
effectively.
</p>
<p>
As simple as all this sounds, the influence of the tools vendors, book 
publishers, and consulting houses trying to make UML sound elaborate, 
complicated, and expensive cannot be ignored. Their efforts
to take these simple conventions for communicating engineering design ideas 
and turn them into something profitable may endanger the 
entire initiative. Is UML worth saving? Can it really
help <i>real</i> projects, projects that produce code, have deadlines,
and live in <i>Guerrilla Development</i> environments?
</p>
<p>
Yes. I believe UML can help. And, as always, I've got a 
few stories from my lurid and sordid past to back up that claim.
</p>
<h2>The Prescriber</h2>
<p>
I began working for a company that made virtual private network software
in the Spring of 1998 and was teamed up with another fellow, Mike (also
a new hire) to work on a part of the project called the <i>Prescriber</i>.
The Prescriber was an interesting concept. It was to be part of the VPN
dialer residing on the client's MS Windows machine that would diagnose
and automatically repair (if possible) problems with the client machine's
configuration, software, or settings. The idea was this: some of
the problems a client might have with his laptop on the road were minor
such as well-known .DLL conflicts or improper network settings. A small,
extensible rules engine might be able to detect and even correct many of
these problems.
</p>
<p>
The initial design of the Prescriber had been done in 
<a href="../_/http/tcl.activestate.com/index.html">TCL</a>
(as one of the other fellows who worked at this company had been a college
classmate of <a href="../_/http/home.pacbell.net/ouster/index.html">John K. Ousterhout</a>,
the developer of TCL). Mike and I
wanted to do the next phase in <a href="../_/http/Java.sun.com/index.html">Java</a>. 
After some discussion, the decision was eventually made
to transition the project to Java and work began in earnest.
</p>
<p>
Mike and I quickly found that we worked well together. We began camping
out in one of the smaller conference rooms and filling the white boards
with ideas. One of the unique aspects of this part of
the project is that the results had to be <i>user extendable</i>. For
example, customers might wish to use the Prescriber to help enforce their IT 
policies. The Prescriber wasn't going to just help establish the VPN 
connection for the client; it was also going to help manage the entire 
VPN experience. This extendibility requirement placed some extra burdens 
on us that other members of the development team did not have.
</p>
<p>
For one thing, our program documentation would need to be much more
extensive than anybody else's. This part of the project was not just
a <i>binary-and-nobody-will-see-the-insides-of-this</i> deliverable.
We had to have a clear structure for the facility with an architecture
that would enable, and even encourage, extendibility. We also had to plan
on having a significantly more detailed documentation set including a
<i>Theory of Operation</i> document so developers in those IT departments
would have some idea of how to create these Prescriber extensions safely.
Creating user-extendable software is not a trivial task. Nardi's book
<i>A Small Matter of Programming</i> discusses this at length.
</p>
<p>

Mike and I needed to work together efficiently and, hopefully, 
create artifacts during our design and implementation phases that 
could be reused later when we created the final 
documentation. Most of all, we needed to run this project so we 
could get some version of the Prescriber done for the next release 
of the dialer, an event only months away.
</p>
<h2>It is the Code, Stupid</h2>
<p>
We needed code and we needed back-up documentation. We also
needed a way to divide up the project so that
Mike and I could work quickly without "stepping on each other". I
began drawing UML class and package diagrams on the white boards
during our marathon design sessions. I'm not sure how much UML Mike
had seen before this point but he was extremely quick to catch on.
We did refinement after refinement on those white boards, seeing
the structure of the product and the relationships between the
pieces. We found a convenient way to divide the problem down the
middle.
</p>
<p>
Things were looking up but, of course, we had yet to write a single 
stitch of code. We needed a way to be as productive in the detailed
design and coding as we had been in this early architectural and 
high-level design phase. The UML diagrams first drawn on the white
boards in the conference rooms had been transferred to my notebooks
but it seemed like a waste to stop there. The descriptions and
relationships in those diagrams had been instrumental in helping
Mike and I understand the problem and our solution. This is <i>exactly</i>
the kind of insight that an IT person extending the Prescriber later
would need. Why can't we carry this forward?
</p>
<p>
I had some experience with UML tools from previous projects. Most
were bulky, buggy, and slow (not to mention expensive). There was
one that had caught my eye, however. The tool's name was 
<a href="../_/http/www.intranetjournal.com/news/blurb227.html">ClassDesigner</a>
and it handled only a couple of the UML diagram types (code and package)
but it had rock-solid round-trip engineering facilities. That is, you 
create your design using class diagrams, use arrows and lines to indicate
the relationships between the classes (inheritance, dependencies, references,
etc.) and then <i>push the button</i> to have the tool generate the 
corresponding Java code. After you've made changes to the code (filling
in the implementations for the methods between the curly braces) you
can update the diagrams and <i>push the button again</i> and the code
is <b>updated</b>. This means your drawing and the associated code can
stay synchronized.
</p>
<p>
This round-trip engineering (being able to continue to generate the code
from the drawings) meant that a couple of our biggest problems would be
solved:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike and I were making changes constantly. This was a way for us
      to keep each other informed and to document the changes.
  </li>
<li>There wasn't going to be a lot of time after the coding was done
      to produce the Theory of Operations document. We'd need to have
      as much of the materials in place as possible. Having the diagrams
      "track" the code meant that they could be used later with high
      confidence.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
I was convinced that ClassDesigner would do the job for us. But, I had
to convince Mike (who was pretty easy-going and thought it was worth a
try) and management. Given that I had spent a <i>lot</i> of points getting
the Java (and not TCL) decision, I wasn't sure if I could go to the well
again so soon. I did. And, to my pleasant surprise, the VP of Engineering
was intrigued by the idea. Of course, he wanted to see more. I agreed to
give him a demonstration of what this tool could do.
</p>
<p>
The other feature a typical UML tool has is <i>reverse engineering</i>.
The tool reads all of your source files and creates appropriate class
diagrams. I reverse engineered the entire project. 
</p>
<p>
As with most projects, some aspects of the development were going better
than others. There was one particular part of the project (no, I'm not
going to say which one!) that had been a point of contention. As I 
untangled the diagrams for the various subsystems, some areas of the
diagram became neat and pretty. Other areas were a bit jumbled but
still intelligible. One area was a mess. Guess which part
of the project that was!
</p>
<p>
Early on a Saturday morning I set up the projector and prepared for
my 1:1 with the VP. When he arrived, I put up a single drawing that
showed a 100,000 foot view of the project. You could see boxes and 
lines but no names. Most of it looked organized but one area looked
completely tangled. He saw it immediately.
</p>
<p>
"My theory", I told him, "is that the design isn't right if the
picture isn't pretty. If the elements of the design have too 
many interdependencies or if there are too many <i>moving parts</i>
that will show up in the diagrams." 
</p>
<p>
"What's this area here?", he asked. It was the allegedly problematic
part of the project. "I wish we had this tool in the beginning", he
said. I knew I'd sold him on the idea. He agreed to get a small number
of licenses for the tool.
</p>
<p>
We produce products that are made of code. But, the structure of these
products, the high-level design and architecture, is not easily viewed 
by just looking at the code. This 100,000 foot view, or <i>topsight</i>
as Gelernter describes in his book <i>Mirror Worlds</i> is more easily
obtained through something like UML. The VP had gained <i>topsight</i>
into his project, possibly for the first time, and he recognized its
value immediately.
</p>
<h2>Resistance</h2>
<p>
My story has been entirely too happy so far. Except for some skepticism
from the VP, we had not run into any resistance concerning UML or 
ClassDesigner. Once we got the go-ahead, however, there was the beginnings
of grumblings about the newfangled tool. Luckily, our part of the project
was isolated enough that few felt threatened by it. The most resistance
came from <b>the vendor</b>.
</p>
<p>
Cayenne Software had purchased the ClassDesigner product from a
one-man company run by a fellow named Naresh Bhatia who followed his product to Cayenne.
Bhatia may have understood what he created but it was clear that few 
others at Cayenne did. When I talked to Cayenne's sales team about obtaining
licenses for the ClassDesigner product they were confused. Was I sure? Didn't
I want the more "capable" (expensive) ObjectTeam product? "No", I insisted,
ClassDesigner does exactly what I need. It is fast, reliable, easy to learn
and use, and is a quarter the price of ObjectTeam. 
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I don't remember how this happened but somehow, I got
roped into doing a full-blown product comparison between ClassDesigner
and ObjectTeam. Perhaps I had mentioned to the VP that the vendor was
pushing this or, more likely, the VP was in on one of the sales calls
and was intrigued by the ObjectTeam pitch made by the Cayenne sales person.
</p>
<p>
I spent a week carefully comparing the products. I took the UML specification
and found that ObjectTeam couldn't actually produce most of the drawings
in the specification. The round-trip engineering was weak (which was the
<i>key</i> feature we were looking for), the interface was muddled, and
it had a nasty tendency to crash just before I had thought about saving
my work. I produced a 30 page report highlighting the deficiencies of
ObjectTeam. I heard later that my report had circulated through some of
the highest circles at Cayenne. The defects and deficiencies were undeniable;
they had just been conveniently "omitted" from any previous status reports from
the ObjectTeam group, apparently.
</p>
<p>
With this behind us, ClassDesigner was <i>officially selected</i>
as our UML tool and Mike and I proceeded to complete the project.
In fact, it worked so well that the VP bought into my suggestion
that we obtain a site license for the product and begin encouraging
other engineers to use it. I negotiated the deal near the end of
Cayenne's next quarter.
</p>
<p>
Then Cayenne was <a href="../_/http/www.itweb.co.za/office/bytes/9808311348.htm">
bought</a> by Sterling Software. Sterling, confused why anyone would buy
ClassDesigner when they could pay four times as much and get ObjectTeam,
promptly killed the product. Furious, I called my Cayenne (now Sterling)
sales person and demanded that we be refunded our site license fee since
the product had actually been killed before we had a chance to deploy
it. Our money was returned.
</p>
<p>
Still hoping to keep UML and UML tools in the loop, we briefly
played with Rational Rose which, like ObjectTeam, was large, slow,
expensive, and buggy. But, the bloom was off the rose (so to speak) and
the efforts to integrate UML into the development process were
abandoned.
</p>
<h2>Observations and Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>
There are several things you might take away from this story:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>White board markers make powerful UML tools</b> One of the most
      important phases of the project was the very beginning when Mike and
      I needed to get organized, create a workable architecture, and divide
      the project up so we could work quickly and efficiently. The UML tool
      we used was a white board and a set of white board markers. I contend 
      these tools are still the best tools available today.
  </li>
<li><b>Most have never seen effective use of UML</b> My manager was
      delighted to see a reverse engineered drawing of his project. For
      the first time since its early days, he believed he could see what
      was going on. Properly done, UML can provide what Gelernter calls
      <i>topsite</i> even late in a project's development cycle. 
  </li>
<li><b>UML tools <i>can</i> be used day-to-day in start-ups</b> Sometimes
      I think the UML vendors believe that only Fortune 500 companies and
      government contractors buy these tools. Well, maybe that's right. But,
      I have existence proofs that projects in high-stress start-ups can
      also be helped greatly by <i>the right tools</i>. ClassDesigner helped
      us kick butt, a fact that was apparently mystifying to its vendor.
  </li>
<li><b>Not all engineers are good designers</b> Yeah, there's a shock!
      Without a reasonable format for articulating the details of a design,
      however, it might be hard to tell the difference between a weak design
      and a weakly presented design. UML can help provide a common structure
      and tool set for designers to exchange ideas. I'm convinced that most
      weak designs are allowed to proceed to the next phase because the
      reviewers never really understood what they were approving. If UML
      can provide clarity during reviews, it might be well worth the effort.
  </li>
<li><b>Vendors are idiots</b> A bit harsh, but too near the truth to 
      dismiss outright. If anybody on the Cayenne sales team had done the
      simple things I had done (like just try to draw the sample diagrams
      from the UML specification with ObjectTeam) they would have easily
      come to the same conclusions I did. But, nobody tried. The sales people
      had <i>no idea whatsoever</i> how this product was going to be used
      day-to-day by us. And, when we explained it, they didn't believe us.
  </li>
<li><b>UML's future depends on breaking out of this tool idiocy</b>
      UML can be a powerful means of expressing design ideas but its future
      is bleak if the kind of idiocy described here is left unchecked. The
      tool vendors need to understand that developers respect tools that
      help them crank out code. Any tools developed need to be rock solid,
      fast, affordable, and <i>adoption-friendly</i>. From what I see, we've
      got a long way to go.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Postscript</h2>
<p>
I have a very good friend (Jeff) who also happens to be an excellent engineer
(and engineering manager). One of the things that makes Jeff an interesting 
person to talk to is the fact that he sees the world much differently that 
I do. He is a very (very, very) verbal person. He gains nothing from 
diagrams; he'd rather read the text. Pictures convey very little information
for him. 
</p>
<p>
I have a season ticket package with the Boston Symphony Orchestra
and asked Jeff if he and his Significant Other wanted to join me and mine
to a concert. "No", he replied. If the music doesn't have words then, to
him, it is just "a lot of pretty sounds". It is nice, of course, but it
doesn't hold any meaning to him. I'd never thought about how <i>visual</i>
music could be until that point, but understood immediately why he might
be reluctant to go. Jeff is the kind of thinker that prefers literature
over music because that is how his brain works.
</p>
<p>
Trying to do a white board session drawing UML diagrams with Jeff would
probably be an exercise in frustration. I'm sure there are plenty of 
engineers out there who, like Jeff, are much more verbal and far less
visual than I am. For those folks, I conceded that UML has very little
to offer you. This is one (of many) reasons why UML cannot be a substitute
for written artifacts.
</p>
<h2>Final note</h2>
<p>
I ran into somebody who had still been associated with the project
this summer, some 4+ years after the first new Prescriber had shipped.
"Had the documentation been helpful?", I asked. "Are you kidding?!",
my friend replied. "It scared the hell out of 'em." I looked aghast.
He continued, "they take one look at the size of the notebook you
left and they say <i>I'm not touching that! It looks complicated!</i>."
<b>Sigh...</b>
