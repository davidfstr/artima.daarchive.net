<p>I've been intrigued by the Go language since I first encountered it about 6 months ago. There are some great online lectures that you can find <a class="reference" href="../_/http/golang.org/doc/docs.html#videos_talks">here</a>.</p>
<p>Go solves a number of problems that C++ and Java didn't. Unlike C++, Go has a garbage collector which eliminates a large class of memory-leak issues. Go has a much cleaner syntax than either language, eliminating a great deal of programmer overhead when writing and reading code. Indeed, based on syntax alone I personally classify Go, along with Scala, as a next-generation language because they respect the needs of the programmer; they <em>serve</em> the programmer rather than telling what hoops must be jumped through.</p>
<p>But one of the biggest issues solved by Go is parallel programming. Go has built-in support for <a class="reference" href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes/index.html">Communicating Sequential Processes</a> (CSP). You can start any function <strong>f()</strong> as a separate process by saying <strong>go f()</strong>, and then communicate with that process using channels (which safely transport messages back and forth). It's worth noting that Go was initially designed to create servers (not web servers per se, just general-purpose servers as we'll explore in this article) and has expanded to a general-purpose systems language; it creates natively-compiled executables and tends to be more closely aligned to the hardware -- thus "goroutines" tend to be tied to the processors/cores of a single machine. Scala, in contrast, seems to be aiming for distributed multiprocessing systems, especially when you look at the direction that <a class="reference" href="../_/http/akka.io/index.html">Akka</a> is going (the rumor is that Akka will eventually be folded into Scala). (There's a project for distributing <a class="reference" href="../_/http/code.google.com/p/golem/index.html">Go across machines</a>).</p>
<p>My interest here is to make the case for <em>hybrid programming</em>. I distinguish hybrid from <em>polyglot programming</em>; the latter means that the programmer has learned and benefits from knowing multiple languages (this is essential, I believe, as it allows you to see solutions in multiple ways rather than being restricted to the lens of a single language). When I say hybrid programming, I mean that a single application is crafted using multiple languages.</p>
<p>In my experience, all languages do some things well but have blind spots. When you use those languages, you can move very quickly when utilizing their "power regions" but the project slows way down and becomes expensive when you encounter the problem areas. Why not use multiple languages and let each one work to its strength?</p>
<p>Python, for example, is an incredibly powerful language for rapid development because of the simplicity and clarity of its syntax and the extensive reach of its libraries. But it has blind spots.</p>
<p>One is building user interfaces. It's not that there are no UI libraries for Python; there are too many! Each one has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you only discover these after you've slogged through and built a UI with each one. The weaknesses are not advertised so you only discover them after putting in significant effort. So here's an example of hybrid programming: in <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=208528.html">this article</a> and in <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=230001.html">this one</a> I create a Python application and use a Flash UI written in Flex, thus getting the best of both worlds (these days, however, everything seems to be shifting to HTML5).</p>
<p>Both Python and Ruby support <em>concurrency</em>, which allows you to program <em>as if</em> you have multiple processing units available. This can be very helpful for code organization. However, neither language can support <em>parallelism</em>: making use of multiple processors or cores. In the <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.html$/thread=230001.html">aforementioned article</a>, I show how to distribute work over multiple cores by using multiple independent Python processes, but that turns out to be a fair amount of work. What if we hybridize the solution by doing the parallelism in Go?</p>
<p>To do this, we must be able to communicate between the two languages. In the past I've used XML-RPC, but in recent years there's been a move towards JSON-RPC. This is similar in many ways to XML-RPC, but it uses the more efficient (and often easier-to-read) JSON to transport data. (Note that this might also make it easier to work with client-side JavaScript). The standard Go library currently provides support for JSON-RPC (but not yet XML-RPC), so that became the obvious choice.</p>
<p>Here is the Go server, which simply echoes whatever is sent to it. The file is named <strong>Server.go</strong>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
package main

import (
  "rpc/jsonrpc"
  "rpc"
  "os"
  "net"
  "log"
)

type RPCFunc uint8

func (*RPCFunc) Echo(arg *string, result *string) os.Error {
  log.Print("Arg passed: " + *arg)
  *result = "&gt;" + *arg + "&lt;"
  return nil
}

func main() {
  log.Print("Starting Server...")
  l, err := net.Listen("tcp", "localhost:1234")
  defer l.Close()
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  log.Print("listening on: ", l.Addr())
  rpc.Register(new (RPCFunc))
  for {
    log.Print("waiting for connections ...")
    conn, err := l.Accept()
    if err != nil {
      log.Printf("accept error: %s", conn)
      continue
    }
    log.Printf("connection started: %v", conn.RemoteAddr())
    go jsonrpc.ServeConn(conn)
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Packaging in Go is reminiscent of other languages. However, <strong>main()</strong> is a special name and if you have a <strong>main()</strong>, Go wants the package name to also be <strong>main</strong>.</p>
<p>You can import other packages one at a time, as in <strong>import "os"</strong>, or you can import them in a block as shown here. The Go compiler gives you an error if you import a package that you don't use.</p>
<p>The <strong>type</strong> statement creates an alias; here it's just to another type but it can also be to something complex like a structure. Go built-in types are very specific -- they don't rely on the vagaries of the underlying machine as C and C++ do. Here, <strong>uint8</strong> refers to an unsigned 8-bit integer. The only reason we're creating a type in this case is because Go's JSON-RPC library requires a class to be registered, and doesn't allow individual functions.</p>
<p>To create a class in Go, you attach methods to a type (in a more typical class, you'd start with a structure to hold the data fields, but in this case we aren't actually using fields so we don't care what the type is). Go's classes would be called "open classes" in Ruby -- you can attach methods at any time. Here, the only method is <strong>Echo()</strong>. Before the name, you see the <em>receiver</em> in parentheses; this is the structure to which you attach the method. In C++ or Java, the receiver is equivalent to the <strong>this</strong> pointer, and in Python it would be <strong>self</strong>. Thus, any time you see a receiver right after the <strong>func</strong> keyword, that's the class this method belongs to. If there's no receiver, it's an ordinary function. (In this case the receiver has no identifier because we are ignoring it in the method body).</p>
<p>Arguments in Go are name first, type second. The return type of the function appears after the closing parenthesis of the argument list. One thing you'll note is that Go has eliminated all redundant syntax -- much like Scala, but it often goes even further. Still, much of the syntax is comfortable for C++, Java and even Python programmers.</p>
<p>Fitting with its server orientation, Go has a built-in <strong>log</strong> package, with familiar <strong>Print</strong>, <strong>Printf</strong> and <strong>Fatal</strong> functions (the last one also exits the current function). While Go has pointers, it doesn't have pointer <em>arithmetic</em>, so it keeps the efficiency of pointers without the pitfalls of the arithmetic. A JSON-RPC method can take a pointer or regular argument, but its result must be a pointer so that you can write into it. It must also return an <strong>os.Error</strong>, which is <strong>nil</strong> if the method call succeeds.</p>
<p>In the second line of <strong>main()</strong> you see something unfamiliar:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
l, err := net.Listen("tcp", "localhost:1234")
</pre>
<p>The call to <strong>net.Listen()</strong> seems ordinary enough, but it produces a <em>tuple</em> of two values as the result, because Go allows multiple return values. You'll most often see it in this form, with the result followed by an error value. But the <strong>:=</strong> is different, too: it means that <strong>l</strong> and <strong>err</strong> are being defined right here and that Go should infer their types. Again, very succinct, dynamic-like behavior for this statically-typed language. In general, you'll find that the Go designers have tried to do everything they possibly can to eliminate coding overhead for the programmer.</p>
<p>The following line introduces a new concept, as well:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
defer l.Close()
</pre>
<p>The <strong>defer</strong> keyword ensures that something will happen regardless of how this function is exited. It's a much cleaner version of Java's <strong>finally</strong>.</p>
<p>For full-blown exceptions, Go has <strong>panic</strong> and <strong>recover</strong> (which I have yet to explore). But for situations you can test for and deal with, you check the error condition when you make a call. This might seem uncomfortable at first if you're used to <strong>try-catch</strong>, but I'm OK with it so far, and it might even have some benefits.</p>
<p>Note that an <strong>if</strong> statement does not have parentheses around the conditional, but it does require curly braces around the body.</p>
<p>The <strong>new</strong> built-in function allocates storage for user-defined types.</p>
<p>In Go, <strong>for</strong> can have three forms: the classic <strong>for init; condition; step; {}</strong>, the Python-like <strong>for i,v:= range Iterable {}</strong> and the while-loop-like <strong>for condition {}</strong>; a special case of this is the infinite-while <strong>for {}</strong> that you see in <strong>main()</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of <strong>main()</strong> you see:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
go jsonrpc.ServeConn(conn)
</pre>
<p>The go keyword creates a "goroutine" out of the function call, and this runs independently of the <strong>main()</strong> thread until it completes. So the server can go back to waiting for more requests while the previous calls are being handled.</p>
<p>The Go team has obviously gained inspiration from other languages. You can even see one clear homage to Python in the documentation, where they advise you to "Keep these under your pillow," a phrase that has long been seen in the Python documentation.</p>
<p>Go is open-source and it's already part of the Ubuntu and Debian distributions (I have heard that Ubuntu is quite interested in developing with Go).</p>
<p>To compile <strong>Server.go</strong>, you'll first need to <a class="reference" href="../_/http/golang.org/doc/install.html">install Go</a>. Go does not yet have its own build system, but it provides include files for simple creation of Makefiles. To turn the above into a compiled executable, the Makefile looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
include /go/src/Make.inc

TARG=Server
GOFILES=\
    Server.go\

include /go/src/Make.cmd
</pre>
<p>You can configure your environment so that <strong>make</strong> handles this, or you can just run <strong>gomake</strong>. The resulting executable will be the <strong>TARG</strong>, which in this case will be called <strong>Server</strong>.</p>
<p>You can create a Go client to test the server like this (<strong>Client.go</strong>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
package main
// Connect to JSONRPC Server and send command-line args to Echo

import (
  "rpc/jsonrpc"
  "os"
  "net"
  "fmt"
)

func main() {
  conn, e := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:1234")
  if e != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Could not connect: %s\n", e)
    os.Exit(1)
  }
  client := jsonrpc.NewClient(conn)
  var reply string
  for i, arg := range os.Args {
    if i == 0 { continue } // Ignore program name
    fmt.Printf("Sending: %s\n", arg)
    client.Call("RPCFunc.Echo", arg, &amp;reply)
    fmt.Printf("Reply: %s\n", reply)
  }
}
</pre>
<p><strong>Dial()</strong> is a general-purpose function for making network connections; here, it's configured to use tcp sockets. From the connection, we produce a JSON-RPC client and use that to make the RPC calls.</p>
<p>Note this line:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for i, arg := range os.Args {
</pre>
<p>This uses the <strong>range</strong> keyword to step through the command-line arguments provided when the program is invoked. The first element of the tuple returned by <strong>range</strong> is the index into the <strong>os.Args</strong> array, and the second is the value at that index. Element zero is the program name, so we ignore that. <strong>range</strong> can also be used to iterate through other kinds of structures, such as <strong>map</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is the Makefile for the client:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
include /go/src/Make.inc

TARG=Client
GOFILES=\
    Client.go\

include /go/src/Make.cmd
</pre>
<p>When trying to call Go from Python, I ran into a snag. There are a number of JSON-RPC libraries for Python, but they all assume that they will be making the connection via HTTP, whereas the current JSON-RPC library in Go supports only raw socket connections. I only discovered this by trying all the Python JSON-RPC libraries, and finally asking the mailing list, which is called <a class="reference" href="../_/http/groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/index.html">Go-Nuts</a>. This turned out to be very helpful; after I thrashed around in frustration, someone finally showed me how to do a raw call to my server:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import json, socket

s = socket.create_connection(("localhost", 1234))
s.sendall(
    json.dumps({"id": 1, "method": "RPCFunc.Echo", "params": ["Cupid's Arrow"]}).encode())
print((s.recv(4096)).decode())
</pre>
<p>This also gives you a pretty good idea of how JSON-RPC works. You can find details in <a class="reference" href="../_/http/json-rpc.org/wiki/specification/index.html">the specification</a>. A call to a JSON-RPC server simply sends a block of data through a socket. The data is formatted as a JSON structure, and a call consists of an <strong>id</strong> (so you can sort out the results when they come back), the name of the <strong>method</strong> to execute on the server, and <strong>params</strong>, an array of parameters which can itself consist of complex JSON objects. The <strong>dumps()</strong> call converts the Python structure into JSON, and the <strong>encode()</strong> and <strong>decode()</strong> calls are necessary to make the program run in both Python 2 and 3.</p>
<p>After the call is made, the result comes back in a buffer with a maximum size of 4096:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
{"id":1,"result":"&gt;Cupid's Arrow&lt;","error":null}
</pre>
<p>Note that the <strong>id</strong> is the same as the one we sent, so we know it's a response to our query. The <strong>result</strong> can be a complex JSON object, and a non-null <strong>error</strong> tells you something has gone wrong.</p>
<p>It felt like a breakthrough when this code worked, but it's an awkward way to make calls. Fortunately, Stephen Day wrote a Python class for making socket-based JSON-RPC calls, and I made some changes so the library will work with both Python 2 and Python 3 (I say Python 2.6 here, but that's only because it was the earliest one I have installed. It might work with earlier versions as well):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

import json, socket, itertools

class JSONClient(object):

    def __init__(self, addr):
        self.socket = socket.create_connection(addr)
        self.id_counter = itertools.count()

    def __del__(self):
        self.socket.close()

    def call(self, name, *params):
        request = dict(id=next(self.id_counter),
                    params=list(params),
                    method=name)
        self.socket.sendall(json.dumps(request).encode())

        # This must loop if resp is bigger than 4K
        response = self.socket.recv(4096)
        response = json.loads(response.decode())

        if response.get('id') != request.get('id'):
            raise Exception("expected id=%s, received id=%s: %s"
                            %(request.get('id'), response.get('id'),
                              response.get('error')))

        if response.get('error') is not None:
            raise Exception(response.get('error'))

        return response.get('result')
</pre>
<p>The constructor creates the socket connection, and makes a counter for the JSON-RPC <strong>id</strong> using <strong>itertools.count()</strong>. This creates an object which increments and produces the new value each time you pass it to <strong>next()</strong>. The destructor closes the socket.</p>
<p>The call to JSON-RPC allows multiple parameters, so <strong>JSONClient.call()</strong> has a variable argument list, <strong>*params</strong>. This comes in as a tuple, so <strong>list(params)</strong> turns it into an array.</p>
<p>The <strong>request</strong> is created as a <strong>dict</strong>, which conveniently converts the keys into strings, so the JSON-RPC elements <strong>id</strong>, <strong>params</strong> and <strong>method</strong> are already in the right form. The call to <strong>json.dumps()</strong> converts the structure into JSON format and returns it as a string; <strong>encode()</strong> is applied to make it Python 3 compatible.</p>
<p>One unfinished part of this code is the response reception, which is currently limited to the maximum buffer size of 4096. To make it more general, it needs to deal with the case when the response is bigger than that. I poked around a little in Python's <strong>socket</strong> documentation, but the best way to handle this was not clear (perhaps the code in Python's XML-RPC library would yield a solution).</p>
<p>The call to <strong>json.loads()</strong> returns a dictionary containing the response information; this allows us to use <strong>get()</strong> to select the various elements.</p>
<p>By placing the library in your local directory, or installing it in your Python library, it's now possible to write a more elegant program to make calls to the Go server:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from jsonclient import JSONClient

rpc = JSONClient(("localhost", 1234))

for i in range(100):
    print(rpc.call("RPCFunc.Echo", "hello " + str(i)))
</pre>
<p>This has only been step one towards making the case for a hybrid program. Next, I will create a Go server to solve an actual parallel programming problem.</p>
<p>Coming from a background in C/C++, I find Go to be a real breath of fresh air. At this point, I think it would be a far better choice than C++ for doing systems programming because it will be much more productive and it solves problems that would be notably more difficult in C++. This is not to say that I think C++ was a mistake -- on the contrary, I think it was inevitable. At the time, we were deeply mired in the C mindset, slightly above assembly language and convinced that any language construct that generated significant code or overhead was impractical. Things like garbage collection or language support for parallelism were downright ridiculous and no one took them seriously. C++ took the first baby steps necessary to drag us into this larger world, and Stroustrup made the right choices in making C++ comprehensible to the C programmer, and able to compile C. We needed that at the time.</p>
<p>We've had many lessons since then. Things like garbage collection and exception handling and virtual machines, which used to be crazy talk, are now accepted without question. The complexity of C++ (even more complexity has been added in <a class="reference" href="../_/http/www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/07/verity_stob_cplusplus/index.html">the new C++</a>), and the resulting impact on productivity, is no longer justified. All the hoops that the C++ programmer had to jump through in order to use a C-compatible language make no sense anymore -- they're just a waste of time and effort. Now, Go makes much more sense for the class of problems that C++ was originally intended to solve.</p>
