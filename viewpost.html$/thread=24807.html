<p>
<p>Recently, I was interviewed by a reporter who was doing a story on the
    difference between east coast engineers and west coast engineers (yes,
    that old chestnut is again being revisited). This in turn got me thinking
    about Dick Gabriel's classic note "Worse is Better", which is often
    credited with first articulating the distinction between the MIT (or east
    coast; after all, what else is there on the east coast) approach to
    engineering (do the right thing, no matter how complex it makes the code)
    and the Berkeley (or west coast) approach to engineering (make the code
    simple, even if it makes the user do more work).

    <p>The notion that worse is better has become something of a truism in the
    programming industry. The usual examples are the C language (worse than
    lisp, but it dominated anyway), Unix (or more recently, Windows) as
    opposed to Multics or VMS, and (in a completely different arena) VHS tape
    over Beta. Each of the dominant technologies, it is pointed out, was worse
    than the alternative, but the worse technology became the standard
    anyway. The moral to the story, or the reason that people bring the
    principle up in argument, is to convince whoever is on the other side of
    the argument that we should set our sights on the quick and dirty, less
    elegant solution to a problem, because "worse is better."

    <p>Of course, this received wisdom is just so much crap. The arguments
      simply don't hold up. But the damage that this principle has done to the
      technology industry is real, and we should start pushing back before we
      do any more harm than we already have done.

    <p>First, the arguments. Gabriel's original writing (which can still be
    found, like everything else, either through Google or by going <a href="../_/http/www.jwz.org/doc/worse-is-better.html">here</a>) makes an
    interesting read, and a number of good points. Reading it again not only
    reminds one of how well it is written, but debunks a lot of the usual
    common knowledge about the article. For example, the piece never
    contrasts the east coast and west coast engineering styles; the two groups
    it talks about are the <i>MIT/Stanford</i> style (one group) and the <i>New
    Jersey</i> style of design. Not nearly so interesting in these days as the
    notion that the contrast in styles is between west coast and east coast.

    <p>The rest of the paper is an excellent analysis for why Lisp lost out to
      C as a programming language, even though Lisp was a superior
      language. Or at least superior on the grounds that <i>Dick</i> found most
      important. But this doesn't necessarily show that Lisp was in fact
      superior to C; it can just as easily be taken to show that the metrics
      that were cited in the article were not the ones that were taken to be
      most important by those choosing a programming language. The fact that C
      produced faster code, was easier to master, was easier to use in groups,
      and ran well on less expensive hardware were not considerations that
      Gabriel found important. But others did. On those metrics, the dominance
      of C as a programming language was an example of better is better, not
      worse is better.

    <p>The old chestnut of beta and vhs is open to the same sort of alternate
      interpretation. On the "worse is better" interpretation, the superior
      quality beta was beaten out by the clearly inferior vhs tape format
      because of some inexplicable perversity of human nature (or the
      machinations of clever marketing people, or the hubris of Sony, who
      owned the Beta brand). But the vhs tapes were capable of recording
      longer programs on a single cassette, and could be played on cheaper
      recorders, and had a number of different suppliers. Thus there were a
      set of metrics on which vhs was the superior technology, and these
      metrics seemed to be the ones that most in the market found to be
      important. Vhs beat out beta not because worse is better, but better in
      some dimensions (cost, time to record) beat out better in other
      dimensions (picture quality).

      <p>Even the case of Unix vs. Multics misses an important point. While
      Multics may have been a better operating system, Unix had the twin
      advantages of actually existing, and running on a wide variety of fairly
      cheap hardware. Windows (and DOS) ran on even cheaper hardware, and
      though it was easy to argue on any technical grounds that you wanted
      that Unix was a better OS than DOS, the property of existence on really
      cheap hardware turned out to the the metric of goodness that appealed to
      the customer. The emergence of Linux as a real choice is beginning to
      give us more evidence in this particular choice; perhaps a better OS
      <bold>is</bold> something that people will choose when other things are
      equal. But when they chose DOS over Unix, things weren't equal.

      <p>In all of these cases, there is an alternate interpretation of the
      choices that were made that lead us to the conclusion that worse is not
      better. Instead, what we see is that better is a complicated notion, and
      can depend on a variety of different metrics. It may be disappointing to
      find out that what we geeks think of as better may not be what our
      customers think is better. But finding this out shouldn't surprise us
      too much.

    <p>Of course, <i>worse is better</i> is a much catchier slogan than
    <i>better depends on your goodness metric</i> or some other, equivalent
    phrase that would actually reflect what was going on. And there is wisdom
    and insight in the original article that can be used by designers, even
    under the catchier (but less historically accurate) slogan.

    <p>My problem with the slogan is that it has become a catch phrase for
      those who either haven't read the original article, or have read it and
      either have forgotten what it really talked about or never understood it
      in the first place. As a catch phrase, it is often used to justify
      shoddy design, or following the crowd rather than doing what is right,
      or as short-hand for the real claim that our customers are too stupid to
      either appreciate or deserve high quality products. Why spend the time
      doing things right, this line of reasoning goes, when we all know that
      <i>worse is better</i>. You are far better off giving the customer
      something that you know is less than what you could produce, because
      they (those simple customers) will think that it is better.

    <p>The end result of this thinking is sloppy products that don't work, are
      hard to use, or are unreliable (or all of the above). We try to convince
      our customers that this is the way software has to be, and then turn
      around and convince ourselves that they won't pay for anything
      better. But we short-change our customers, and we cheapen our craft, when
      we put up with this sort of thinking. When the original article was
      produced, I don't think that this is what the author had in mind; even
      if it was, it is time for us to reject the simple-minded interpretation
      of the slogan, and start putting out software that really is better (on
      the dimension of goodness that our customers have, not necessarily our
      own).
