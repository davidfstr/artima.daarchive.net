Almost everyone who teaches object orientation uses
the class as a fundamental building block.
Such an approach misses the central point of object
orientation:  the objects themselves, and what they
portend for flexibility and effective design.
This weblog is a case study in teaching object orientation.

<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
Welcome to my new blog!
It's a pleasure to be here among such good company.
This is my first blogging foray, and I'm looking forward
both to exploring this new medium and to using the medium
for exploring my own learnings together with the rest of you.

<p>
It may be good to start with introductions.
I am an Electrical Engineer and Computer Scientist
by training, having received degrees in these
fields in 1977 and 1979, respectively.
I capped off my education with a Ph.D. three
years ago.
Most of my work career has been at Bell Laboratories,
where I started in 1979.
I spent my early Bell Labs years on a large
development project and then moved on to a technology
transfer organization, where I spent more than a decade
doing early work with the C++ language,
with distributed workstations,
and version and configuration management.
When I left Bell Labs in 2001, I had been in the
Research area for about 10 years.
Most of my research focused on software architecture
(including the foundational work on software patterns) and
organizational structure.

<p>
I am a long-time critic of some of the value systems
and practices of academics in general and of academic
computer science in particular.
I have worked over the past decade to gain
first-hand credibility with academic culture, both
to further my understanding of the issues and to
gain the credentials that might one day allow me
to change the field from the inside.
That's where I am now, and that's what I do.
I teach computer science at
<a href="../_/http/noctrl.edu/index.html">North Central College</a>,
and also teach discrete mathematics and English composition.
I am also the
<a href="../_/http/www.vub.ac.be/e-brief/pnl/archief/270103/onderwijs.html">Vloebergh
Professor of Computer Science</a>
at <a href="../_/http/www.vub.ac.be/index.html">Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a>
and am a
<a href="../_/http/www.co.umist.ac.uk/research/visiting_professors.htm">Visiting
Professor</a> of 
<a href="../_/http/www.co.umist.ac.uk/index.html">Computer Science</a> at
<a href="../_/http/www.umist.ac.uk/index.html">University
of Manchester</a> (formerly UMIST).

<p>
I plan on using this space to reflect on experiences
I haven't yet committed to writing, and particularly
my recent experiences as an educator.
I frequently admonish my English composition
students with Forster's saw:
"How can I know what
I think until I see what I say?"
I hope that mindset serves me well here,
and that it provides you an opportunity to challenge
your worldviews and to respond in your own
pen with your own thoughts.

<h1>Teaching Design</h1>
<p>
At the
<a "="" href="../_/http/www.acm.org/sigplan/oopsla/oopsla99/2_ap/2f_edusym.html">OOPSL
A  
1999 Educators' Symposium</a>, I emphasized
the importance of teaching design in undergraduate computer science
curricula.
I'm trying to put my money where my mouth is now that
I'm in that position.
I taught object-oriented analysis and design this term.
It became an interesting opportunity because it forced
me to think about what's <i>really</i> important about objects:
one can leave only so many ideas in a student's head
over the course of a few short weeks, so it's important
to make a lasting impression about the key elements.  

<p>
It would have been easy enough to focus on the standard
set of principles:  coupling and cohesion, perhaps
modularity, and of course the <i>piece de resistance</i>,
polymorphism.
But I found it difficult to justify these principles from
any value proposition that I felt I could sell to the students.
So it was time to go back to basics, and that's what I did.

<p>
And of course I wanted to feature the main attractions of
contemporary object-oriented analysis and design.
The CS department is driven to a large degree by input
from an industry board.
That board conveys pressing industrial needs, and we respond.
We add formal foundation courses to round out the
collection of courses.
So in the interest of giving students something
practical and current, I knew that both Use Cases
and CRC cards would figure strongly in the material.

<h3>A Two-Pronged Approach: Function and Structure</h3>
<p>
What I ended up doing was to present design as a two-pronged
excercise:  structural design, and functional design.
Structural design gives a system the long-term stable
structure that can reduce discovery costs,
localize maintenance work, and provide a foundation for reuse.
The main component of structure--in the conventional
view--is the system classes and the relationships
between them.

<p> 
The other perspective is functional design.
Though it featured more strongly in some of the
earliest design approaches for computer programming,
it has made a resurgence in object-oriented
days in the guise of Use Cases.

<p> 
Both structure and function are important to
profitability.
When we think of profitability we most often
think of the functional side:
What can we sell, and for how much?
The functional side is directly visible to 
the customer.
Function is what customers are willing to
spend money for;  it is the direct customer
value that software enterprises deliver.
A common view is that
good function, delivered in a timely fashion,
is the hearbeat of a thriving enterprise.

<p>
Profitability isn't only about revenue,
but about cost as well.
Good structure holds down
development costs by localizing change.
It might also reduce cost by making the code
easier to understand and hence to modify.
Even though customers don't care about internal  
structure--they probably don't even see it--they
will pay a price for poor structure in feature
delivery schedules and perhaps even in the very
feasibility of some features.
Experience tends to bear out that poor design
shows through all the way to the end user, too,
as Brenda Laurel points out in her seminal book
<i>Computers as Theatre</i> (Addison-Wesley, 1993).
These are competitive considerations in
the marketplace, considerations that affect
the <i>revenue</i> stream.
Beneath these factors lurks the increase in
raw development <i>cost</i> that owes to
poor structuring:  long discovery times,
or more intense coordination across major interfaces.

<p>
These last few paragraphs seem to have sidetracked
us from a focus on good object-oriented pedagogy to
business practices.
I bring up the business perspective not so much
because I feel that academia should take industry
as its primary client.
Computer science to the contrary not withstanding,
academia has a long legacy of being the cradle
of great new ideas whose relevance isn't appreciated
until many years after their "discovery."  
However, industrial practice is often a good
litmus test for the viability of our design models
and of the teaching models that convey them.

<p>
I highlight this dichotomy between structure and
function because it relates directly to how software
design is often taught, as well as because it can
relate to the "real concerns" of the business world.
We have seen the history of software development
pass through fads that cycle back and forth
between structure and function.
<i>Structured design</i> is often caricatured as relating
to structure. 
It was followed by structured programming, which
focused more on program flow (function) than on  
the structure per se;  structure was subordinate
to function.
Then came abstract data types, and slightly later,
object orientation:  the functional view got the short
shrift.
Finally, came Use Cases: a noble attempt to resurrect
the functional view.
That's where we are now.

<p> 
I believe there are some simple ways to
integrate the functional and structural view.
This integration has some surprising results
for how we view object oriented design and
its activities, and has repercussions that
go far beyond pedagogy.
Let's have a look at the common contemporary
processes of object-oriented design and
contrast them with a simple alternative 
view.

<h1>Classes, Objects, and Other Things</h1>
<h2>Teaching OO: The Class-ical Way</h2>
<p>
If you look at most syllabi to seek out the single
most fundamental concept of object-oriented 
programming, I'm guessing that we'd find it 
to be the <i>class</i>.

<p>
If you ask people about object-oriented <i>design</i>
notations such as UML, most people naturally think about class
diagrams. 
Object diagrams and dynamics are almost always
secondary to the class model.
Even when faced with an object model of their
own making, most programmers have difficulty
answering the question:  "Where did that
object come from, and where was it created?"
We extrapolate our static source code view into 
how we model the application as a whole.
Maybe we do that to avoid the complexities of   
the highly dynamic object structure;
an object model either can capture the
relationships as they exist at a single
moment in time or, as is more likely done,
combine some relatively arbitrary collection
of relationships that cover a span of execution.
But class models already capture many such
relationships anyhow.
    
<p>
If you ask people about the building blocks  
of object-oriented <i>programming</i> they will
also likely mention classes.
Most popular programming languages use
classes as their basic building block.
Classes are the foundation of object-based   
and object-oriented programming in C++.
They are unavoidable in Java and Smalltalk.
Thinking ahead to coding, most designers
bring the programming constructs into
their design thinking.
This <i>is</i> a natural and healthy
practice--but as all practices must be  
tempered with other considerations as
we'll see later.

<p>
Trygve Reenskaug 
(author of <i>Working with Objects</i>,
Prentice-Hall, 1996)
notes that this is pretty funny:
we call it <i>object</i>-oriented programming,
yet we tend to focus on classes.
There are some strong cognitive reasons behind
the human tendency to focus on classes. 
Humans love to classify and organize to help 
their understanding.
Classes are a way of grouping lots of related
objects from the perspective of structure.
We feel a sense of power in this grouping.   
What's more, we become a bit drunk on this  
same power when we discover that we can group
related classes together into a hierarchy   
under a single base class.
Classes become king.

<p> 
This isn't the first time that the class
tradition has come into question.
The <a href="../_/http/research.sun.com/self/papers/papers.html">self</a> programming language,
pioneered by Dave Ungar and Randy Smith, demonstrated that  
a real programming language based on objects
instead of classes could deliver powerful 
flexibility and convenience.
Both Ungar's vision of flexibility and
Trygve's vision of objects would find
vindication later in history as components   
became popular.
Components are heralded for their improved
flexibility over objects, something I suspect
Ungar always had in mind.
Trygve Reenskaug, on the other hand, said   
that components were what he <i>always</i>
envisioned object-oriented programming to  
be from the beginning.
Classes have prevented these two visions
from flourishing and in fact may make
it difficult for fledgling practitioners to
appreciate the fundamental benefits of  
object orientation itself--particularly
the benefits of combining the structural
and functional views.
   
<p>
Even though we have Use Cases in a very few   
contemporary course syllabi, classes rule in
software engineering education. 
We tend to keep Use Cases in our back pocket
in case someone asks where we capture functional
requirements.
But they tend to fall out of our back pocket 
and get lost once we move on to class design,
based perhaps on the misplaced belief that
the class member functions capture all
we need to remember about the functional view.
And the classes have a strongly hierarchical
nature to their structure.

<p>
But there are two problems here:
the functional view
still is important, and that the world  
is rarely very hierarchical.
We can "make" the world appear hierarchical
from a structural view.
But it is rarely possible even to reconcile 
the functional view with this hierarchical
structure.
And because the functional view is key to
what generates your key revenues, that's a
problem:  you don't sell classes, you sell   
functionality. 

<h2>Teaching OO: The Next Generation</h2>
<p>
Much of object-oriented pedagogy (and perhaps
of pedagogy in general) seems to be based on hierarchy.
The high point of many expositions of object orientation
comes with the revelation of inheritance hierarchies
supported by run-time polymophism.   
I think this tendency to hierarchy comes from our
need to organize--and that's fine--but I think
it goes too far in most expositions of object orientation.
It often goes so far as to <i>eliminate</i> information
to reduce apparent complexity.
There is a term for the elimination of information: <i>abstraction</i>.
   
<p>
While we want to organize essential complexity and
minimize accidental complexity, it is dangerous to
put aside elements of essential complexity. 
Such elements will be important either in an early
offering of the system or will become important
as the system evolves.
It's best to put the right framework in place
for these "details" up front;  it may be  
almost impossible to add them later.
Mies van der Rohe said, "God is in the details."
<p>
Hierarchy has become an important abstraction
tool in many design paradigms.
Used effectively, it brings organizational
power.
Used to shed essential complexity, it is evil.
In most object oriented design, most abstraction
is evil.
It is an excuse to ignore things we don't   
want to deal with even though we should.  

<p> 
We start to reduce complexity by grouping 
objects together into classes, which is      
in accordance with how most popular programming
languages work.
These programming languages are popular because
they are efficient.
But then we take an overly casual and slightly
dangerous leap from this hierarchy of objects
to hierarchies of classes.

<p>
Why is this dangerous?
There are several ways to describe this danger,  
but I'll focus on one.
When we group objects together the result isn't
an object:  it's something different, a <i>class</i>.  
That's a healthy distinction that helps the designer
look at a program in two useful ways:
the dynamic structure of objects,
and the static, source-code structure of classes.
But when we combine a hierarchy of related classes
under a common construct that groups them together,
we too often just use the concept of "class" again.
The problem is that it's not a class any more:
it's not a single structure that captures the  
structure of all the objects of all the classes
being grouped together.
Making this level of abstraction into a class
discards the information that the resulting entity
stands in for a larger number of classes in the 
subtending inheritance graph.


<h3>Roles to the Rescue</h3>
<p>
This perspective precipitates two interesting insights.
The first is that for a class-based OO educator,
this level of compression points out
a missing concept:  the elusive concept that
ties related classes together.
That missing concept is a <i>role</i> and   
has long been featured in what were considered
to be offbeat design methods like Reenskaug's
OORAM.
A role characterizes part of the interface of an object,
such that the responsibilities characterize some sphere
of knowledge or influence.
A given object can take on several roles at once.
Consider a Circle object as an example:  we can
ask it to yield its circumference, location, or area;
we can ask it to move, rotate or warp:
these owe to a role we might call Shape.
We may also want Circle to respond to requests
to draw itself on some output medium, or to
change its color: these owe to a role called Drawable.
An image file object might also respond to all
the responsibilities of Drawable, though that may
be all that images have in common with Shapes.

<p>
The second insight is that progress in programming  
languages has caught up with this reality:
roles appear as a first-class programming
construct in the guise of Java interfaces.

<p>
There are interesting corrollaries to these insights.
The first is that roles are more about objects than
they are about classes.
A class is a total classification of objects.  
Rather than thinking of a role as a partial
interface to some class,
it might be better to think of it as a
partial classification of a set of objects. 
To me, that suggests deferring classes
until students have mastered the concepts
of objects: the grouping of responsibilities,
and the colocation of active data and the
functions that operate on them.

<p>
Second, because they are not total classifications
roles break down the tyrrany of hierarchy.
That is a better match for the real world.  
When God created the world, she did not create
it as a hierarchy of classes.
She may not even have created it, as Kant might
insist, from a universe of discrete, identifiable
objects.
Roles provide the freedom to define a software
reality that can align with a myriad of important
design perspectives that range from the marketing
view to the structural view.
A class is, after all, just an implementation
of what might be a degenerate kind of role.

<p>
Third, because roles are closer to objects,
they are closer to the structure of Use Cases 
than classes are.
Objects are run-time animals, and the role
interface to an object reflects a set of
responsibilities related more by some function
than by any structural consideration.
Yet as partial classifications, roles can 
also bridge the gap to the structural world.
This is perhaps the most powerful contribution
of roles:  as a locus for the intersection
of structure and function.

<h1>Pedagogical Reflections on Design</h1>
<p>
My challenge at the beginning of this term was
to sort out the whole notion of object-oriented
design for cogent presentation to a wide variety
of students.
I had a hunch that an object-based focus
would win out over a class-based approach
(in terms of comprehensibility and conceptual
integrity).
And I followed the haunting voice of Trygve
in the back of my head, both with regard to
the centrality of objects and with regard
to the place of roles in design.
The result was wonderfully satisfying.

<p>
Very early in the class, perhaps on the first
day, I introduced the traditional design
dichotomy between function and structure.
I put this in the context of design approaches
that historically preceded objects in their   
own fifteen minutes of fame.
That objects were not an end-all and be-all
would be a recurring theme in the course,
though the course itself focused on objects  
without going into other approaches in any depth.

<p>
I then introduced a simple notion
of objects as loci of structure and behavior. 
From the outside, all we see of an object
are behaviors through which we can ask it to do
things on our behalf.
That was a natural lead-in to abstract
data types, with a careful emphasis on the
"abstract" and "type" parts of the moniker.
Note that students faced ADTs quite a bit   
before they would encounter classes.
I avoided class and language issues, but  
focused on things that are important from
the perspective of Conway's Law--the rule
that says that software architecture exists
mostly for the sake of the structure of
the organization that builds it.
With those ideas grounded, I could move
on to classes, but more as a convention
of packaging than as any important unit
of intrinsic structure.

<p>
At about the same time I introduced roles
as being the analysis or design counterpart
of what we had been talking about as ADTs. 
I made the perfunctory concessions to C++  
and its convention to use pure abstract base
classes as a way to capture the semantics
of roles and ADTs, and appealed to the notion
of Java interfaces with which they were already
familiar.

<p>
Next I introduced Use Cases.
We introduced fat and thin Use Cases following
a conventional exposition, using Alistair     
Cockburn's <i>Writing Effective Use Cases</i>
book (Addison-Wesley, 2000).

<p>
Then, and only then, did I introduce CRC cards.  
CRC cards are the place where the structure
of classes comes together with the dynamics of Use Cases.
A hands-on CRC exercise provided the students with a vision of how
dynamics help shape the structure, and how the
structure yields insight into the dynamics.
For me, this was the high point of the 
object modeling part of the course.
It represents the central essence of object orientation.

<p>
Oh, yes, we went on to do inheritance and   
polymorphism to round out the picture,
and later went on to more advanced concepts
including reflection, aspects, and most other
buzzwords of the contemporary object-oriented
arena.
We also covered the perfunctory issues of
covariance and contravariance, building largely
on the Liskov Subsitutability Principle but
more broadly grounding the issue of subtyping
in Bertrand Meyer's taxonomy of IS-A inheritance,
supported by Design By Contract.
And of course we covered patterns and a few
more popular topics.
But more importantly we came back and reflected
on where we had been, and critiqued the
various structure techniques much as one finds
in the discussion of the piece you're reading here.

<h3>CRC Cards Tie it All Together</h3>
<p>
CRC cards were created by Ward Cunningham
(see his blog at this site) back in the
Smalltalk days at Tektronix (or perhaps it was at Wyatt).
Smalltalk features classes as its staple building blocks
so it was natural to take those concepts into the
design arena.

<p>  
But a programming language class conveys both
behavior and structure, while the CRC card
approach quickly settled on a responsibility-driven
approach. 
CRC cards are all about what an object can <i>do</i>
rather than being about what an object <i>is</i>.
In fact, they look more like roles than like  
classes!
Kent Beck, who has worked closely with Ward
over the years and who has done much of the work
to popularize CRC cards, once remarked in a workshop
that CRC cards weren't really about classes but
about roles.

<p>
In fact, CRC cards are a powerful hybrid representation
that brings classes, objects and roles together.
When Kent and Ward do CRC card exercises, they tend
to think of a card as an object when you are holding
it in the air, and as a class when it's on the table.
The responsibility focus is a way to keep the design
close to the Use Cases:
Use Cases come down to collection of responsibilities,
and object-oriented design is in large part the  
activity of grouping those responsibilities together.
CRC cards do that.
The resulting entities may or may not be building
blocks;  what makes a good building block depends
in part on embedded software, available software
packages, and even tradition.
CRC cards can capture that, too

<p>
This perspective on Use Cases, objects, roles and classes
let me integrate them together around a small number
of intuitive concepts.
If students understand what responsibilities are, they
can understand Use Cases and can certainly understand roles.
Looking at objects as locales of structure and behavior 
makes object-oriented design "real" in terms of the programming world familiar
to them, and bringing in the concept of classes as optimizations
(sharing member function code and a structural skeleton across objects)
makes it concrete in terms of a programming language.
Rather than clumsily introducing Use Cases as a front-end
to the "find the objects" exercise, or of explaining the
similarities and differences between responsibility-based
design and some other flavor of object-oriented design,
this approach serves to point to a larger, single   
underlying model of which classes, objects, Use Cases
and roles are just facets.

<p>
It is this underlying model that I would call   
the object paradigm.

<p>
By the end of the course, students could tie together
the basic concepts of responsibilities, objects, classes,
and roles.
They understood how Use Cases fit into the process.
They understood the interplay between the functional
and structural views of the system as embodied in   
Use Case responsibilities and classes respectively--a
view that takes students all the way from the classes
of programming to the organizational structures that
separate functional concerns from structural concerns.

<p>
I'm guessing that most people who teach CRC cards
teach them as classes rather than as roles.
People gravitate toward classes for the same reasons
we discussed earlier: reducing the amount of information
one must deal with, and talking about design in terms
that already are familiar from programming.
I am concerned that this misses the essential
foundations not only of CRC cards but, more worrisomely,
the responsibility-based foundations of object orientation
itself.

<p>
And here's the punch line:  it isn't only pedagogy that
falls short on these issues.
Most designers in the real world tend to work the same way.
It is at least sad, and perhaps scary, that most people
are using object orientation in a way that is based
on modules with polymorphism and instantiation rather
than on a more living design approach that embraces
Use Cases and the dynamic view that objects bring.

<h1>Beyond Pedagogy: Fundamentals of Design</h1>
<p>
In some sense, one can look at this exercise in crafting a
course on object-oriented analysis and design
as an exercise in building an object model.
It's important to understand that I didn't approach
it that way.
I focused on fundamentals, fundamentals
that led to fundamental benefits such as ease of
evolution, accommodation for Conway's Law,
software compression, and relationship to business goals.
It was a quite un-academic tact.
A more academic tact would have started either
with programming language or perhaps wth type theory
and the semantics of inheritance.

<p>
It was satisfying to see that this approach tied to 
the fundamental notions of design in a way that
may not be satisfying to someone looking to tout
the benefits of a given programming language or
methodology, but that might be more satisfying to
someone with a degree in engineering or architecture.
Design is the collection of activities and tools that
take one from the understanding of a problem to its solution.

<p>
<i>What problem you are solving?</i>
In a companion course on Systems Analysis,
we teach students that this is one of the most 
important questions you can ask.
This question is too often lost in most contemporary
object-oriented development, since objects focus
more on the structural component of design than
on the functional leg of design.

<p>
There was an activity in the 1970s called the 
"design movement" that included people as disparate  
as Peter Naur (the "N" in "BNF") and Christopher   
Alexander.
(See <i>Developments in Design Methodology</i>
by Nigel Cross, Wiley, 1984.)
Much of their work focused on the interplay back
and forth between the problem domain and solution
domain.
The "problem domain" brings customer desires and
needs.
What the design movement learned is that this
customer view should be tempered with the realities
that unfold during design.
In software, we know this as iterative design.
In the object-oriented analysis course we
typified the solution component as the class
structure, and the customer problem component
as the Use Cases.
CRC cards are the place where these two worlds
come together--where struggles with the solutuion offer
insight into the problem itself.
Reconciling these forces both keeps the customer
happy by meeting functional requirements,
and keeps the enterprise happy by leading
to a structure that best accommodates evolution.    

<p> 
Infusing roles is a good lead-in for many other
features of the object community.
Aspects can be described as collections of
roles in a more straightforward way than
is feasible from a basis in classes. 
The focus on Conway's Law is a direct
lead-in to refactoring.

<p>
These results are not just academic.
They do in fact lead to an object model
and a design approach that accommodates 
that model.
But it is more than an object model: it
is also a business model and a process
model, a model that is practical,
teachable, and perhaps even powerful.
What, in summary, is the development approach
based on that model?

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Elicit functional requirements from
customers and other stakeholders and
capture them as use cases.
<li>
In parallel, capture structural and non-functional
requirements that come from the embedded base and
from domain experts.
<li> 
Use CRC cards to iterate the Use Cases and
class structures against each other.
<li>
Precipitate classes and roles from the CRC
cards.
Classes come from total classifications,
and roles are partial classifications that
relate to Use Case-centered concerns 
<li>
Code it up, and use the insights
from the coding experience as input 
to further iterations of the CRC exercise.
</li></li></li></li></li></ol>
<p>
That's it.
On one hand, none of the notions are individually
profound.
But on the other hand, this perspective 
combines a small number of fundamental
concepts into a consistent, integrated 
picture of the fundamentals of object 
orientation.
