<b>Summary</b><br/>
One of the most surpising things I've recently become aware of is how we as technologists are viewed by the non-technology public. We are assumed to be able to do the most remarkable things, which often lead to panic on the part of the general public and, worse yet, policy makers. We should do something about this, but I'm not quite sure what.

<p>
I just got back from a fairly interesting <a href="../_/http/www4.nas.edu/webcr.nsf/MeetingDisplay1/CSTB-L-04-02-A/index.html">workshop</a>, held by the National
    Academies, on RFID technology. The workshop brought together people who
    were actively working on the technology, people who work on related
    technology (since most of the RFID readers will be connected to a network,
    they decided to ask me), and a lot of people who are excited about the
    technology, either positively or negatively.

    <p>
One of the more spirited of the discussions at the workshop had to do with
      privacy and RFID tags. This was a hot topic, and it was all the workshop
      organizers could do to hold it to the one sessions for which it was
      scheduled (they did a pretty good job, but it kept leaking out). This is
      an important topic (along with privacy in a world of interconnected
      computers, databases, and sensors) which will be treated in this report
      and others from the National Academies, but not here.

    <p>
Instead, I'm going to talk about the realization I had in the midst of the
      discussion, which was that there is a huge gap between what technology
      can do and what people who aren't technologists think it can
      do. This can lead to a real disconnect when technologists try to talk to
      non-technologists, and often means that there is far more heat than
      light in discussions about the directions of technology. And I think
      that it is a gap that we, as technologists, need to actively begin to
      start narrowing.

    <p>
My favorite example of this is the <a href="../_/http/www.backfire.dk/EMPIRENORTH/newsite/products_en001.htm">"RFID Sniper Rifle."</a> An ad for this
      appeared recently; supposedly this can shoot an RFID tag with great
      accuracy for the distance of a thousand yards, injecting the
      tag under the skin of the target with no more pain than that caused by a
      mosquito bite. After insertion, the target person can be tracked from
      hundreds of yards away so that you will always know where they are. The
      ad comes complete with a very slick looking picture of the rifle.<p>

      What is depressing is the number of people who take this seriously. The
      amount of basic science that this violates is pretty high (insertion
      without pain at that distance would take a lot of force, which at
      shorter distances would cause a considerable hole to be formed; RFID
      tags either have a short range or a battery, etc., etc.). But even when
      I've pointed these things out to people, they either answer
      <ul>
<li> Well, you can't do it today, but how about in five/ten/twenty
	years; or
      <li> You may now do it, but I bet <em>they</em> can.
    </li></li></ul>
<em>They</em>, it turns out, varies from the federal government to the
    local police to MicroSoft/General Motors/favorite-evil-corporation,
    depending on the paranoid tendencies of the speaker.<p>

      At one level, it is amusing to see what we as technologist are thought
      of as being able to do by those who are not familiar with the limits of
      technology. Often this is because we are asked the wrong questions when
      such discussions come up-- rather than asking us what is now possible,
      we are often asked whether or not something might be possible in 10 or
      20 years. I can't look into the future that far, but given the kinds of
      changes that have occurred over the past 20 years, I'd be hard pressed
      to say that something <em>couldn't</em> happen other than,
      perhaps, faster than light-speed travel. But that is a very different
      question to what I think can be done now, or in the next five years.<p>

      All of this would be harmlessly amusing if it weren't for the fact that
      there are laws that are being passed based on misunderstandings of the
      capabilities of technology. Some of these have to do with digital
      rights, others with privacy, and others with spam, viruses, and
      worms. Many of these are based on at best incorrect and at worst bizarre
      notions of what technology can do. And they will determine what we as
      technologists can and can't do in the future.<p>

      I'm not sure I know what the solution to this problem is. The usual
      thing to call for at this point is more education, but in a country
      where it is still controversial to teach the
      <a href="../_/http/www.natcenscied.org/index.html">theory of evolution</a>, I'm
      not at all sure that education is going to do much good. Perhaps it is
      time for those of us who do understand the technology to be more active
      in the formation of policy, although with few exceptions technologists
      make really bad politicians. At the least, we should try to correct
      those who believe that technology is capable of every and anything, and
      make sure that we don't confuse the sorts of things we believe might be
      possible some day with the kinds of things that can be done now.<p>
