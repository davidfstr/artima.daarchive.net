<b>Summary</b><br/>
In a recent discussion, there were assertions that C++ was a poorly-designed language. I was on the C++ Standards Committee for 8 years, and saw the decisions take place. I think it's helpful to understand the language choices for both C++ and Java in order to see the bigger perspective.

<p>
<p>That said, I hardly ever use C++ anymore. When I do, it's either examining legacy code, or to write performance-critical sections, typically as small as possible to be called from other code (my preferred approach is to quickly write an app in Python, then profile it and if necessary improve performance by calling small portions of C++ using Python's <strong>ctypes</strong> library).</p>
<p>Because I was on the C++ Standards Committee, I saw these decisions
being made. They were all extremely carefully considered, far more so
than many of the decisions made in Java.</p>
<p>However, as people have rightly pointed out, the resulting language
was complicated and painful to use and full of weird rules that I
forget as soon as I'm away from it for a little while -- and I figured
out those rules from first principles while I wrote books, not just by memorizing them.</p>
<p>To understand how the language can be both unpleasant and complicated,
and well designed at the same time, you must keep in mind the primary
design decision upon which everything in C++ hung: compatibility with
C. Stroustrup decided -- and correctly so, it would appear -- that the
way to get the masses of C programmers to move to objects was to make
the move transparent: to allow them to compile their C code unchanged
under C++. This was a huge constraint, and has always been C++'s
greatest strength ... and its bane. It's what made C++ as successful as it
was, and as complex as it is.</p>
<p>It also fooled the Java designers who didn't understand C++ well
enough. For example, they thought operator overloading was too hard
for programmers to use properly. Which is basically true in C++,
because C++ has both stack allocation and heap allocation and you must
overload your operators to handle all situations and not cause memory
leaks. Difficult indeed. Java, however, has a single storage
allocation mechanism and a garbage collector, which makes operator
overloading trivial -- as was shown in C# (but had already been shown
in Python, which predated Java). But for many years, the partly line
from the Java team was "Operator overloading is too complicated." This
and many other decisions where someone clearly didn't do their
homework is why I have a reputation for disdaining many of the
choices made by Gosling and the Java team.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other examples. Primitives "had to be included for
efficiency." The right answer is to stay true to "everything is an
object" and provide a trap door to do lower-level activities when
efficiency was required (this would also have allowed for the hotspot
technologies to transparently make things more efficient, as they
eventually would have). Oh, and the fact that you can't use the
floating point processor directly to calculate transcendental
functions (it's done in software instead). I've written about issues
like this as much as I can stand, and the answer I hear has always been some
tautological reply to the effect that "this is the Java way."</p>
<p>When I wrote about how badly generics were designed, I got the same
response, along with "we must be backwards compatible with previous
(bad) decisions made in Java." Lately more and more people have gained
enough experience with Generics to see that they really are very hard
to use -- indeed, C++ templates are much more powerful and consistent
(and much easier to use now that compiler error messages are
tolerable). People have even been taking reification seriously --
something that would be helpful but won't put that much of a dent in a
design that is crippled by self-imposed constraints.</p>
<p>The list goes on to the point where it's just tedious. Does this mean
Java was a failure? Absolutely not. Java brought the mainstream of
programmers into the world of garbage collection, virtual machines and
a consistent error handling model (especially if you subtract checked
exceptions, which is possible using techniques I show in <em>Thinking in Java, 4e</em>). With
all its flaws, it moved us up a level, to the point where we are now
ready for higher-level languages.</p>
<p>At one point, C++ was the leading language and people thought it would
always be so. Many think the same about Java, but Java has made it
even easier to replace itself, because of the JVM. It's now possible for
someone to create a new language and have it run as efficiently as
Java in short order; Previously, getting a correct and efficient
compiler took most of the development time for a new
language.</p>
<p>And we are seeing this happen -- both with higher-level static
languages like Scala, and with dynamic languages, both new and ports,
like Groovy, JRuby and Jython. This is the future, and the transition
is much smoother because you can easily use these new languages in
conjunction with existing Java code, and you can rewrite bottlenecks
in Java if necessary.</p>
<p>Java itself will diminish, just as C++ did, to be used in special
cases (or perhaps just to support legacy code, since it doesn't have
the same connection to hardware as C++ does). But the unintentional
benefit, the true accidental brilliance of Java is that it has created
a very smooth path for its own replacements, even if Java itself has
reached the point where it can no longer evolve. All future languages
should learn from this: either create a culture where you can be
refactored (as Python and Ruby have done) or allow competitive species
to thrive.</p>
