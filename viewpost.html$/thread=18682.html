<h1>Overall Impressions</h1>

This was the best conference I've been too so far.  I will be making a
point of getting there from now on.  Just go to the <a href="../_/http/www.jaoo.dk/index.html">conference site</a> and look at the speaker
list.  Look at the names you see.... (here's a sampling of those that
caught my attention):

<ul>
<li>Andy Hunt &amp; Dave Thomas - These two wrote the book that has been
career shaking for many: <i>The Pragmatic Programmer</i>
<li>Bill Venners - Active in the Jini community (Bill was responsible
for the "Service UI" project), and maintainer of <a href="../_/http/www.artima.com/index.html">artima.com</a>.

<li>Bjarne Stroustrup - the creator of C++.

<li>Bo Leuf - coauthor of <i>The Wiki Way</i>
<li>Doug Lea - Mr. concurrency

<li>Erich Gamma - one of the Gang of Four and at the center of Eclipse

<li>Gilad Bracha - a name well known to Java aficionados

<li>Jim Coplien - if you don't know this name... where have you been?

<li>Joshua Bloch - the author of <i>Effective Java</i>... if you
program using Java and haven't read this book, you should be sued for negligence.

<li>Kent Beck - it's hard to list everything Kent's done... suffice to
say he's been an early adopter and driving force behind a variety of
things: OO, Smalltalk, Design Patterns, extreme programming, etc.  

<li>Kevlin Henny - a regular on the European conference circuit, and a
regular in a variety of OO &amp; C++ publications.

<li> Martin Fowler - Patterns, refactoring, pragmatic UML... Martin's
the authority.

<li>Mike Hill - Mike may not be a big name yet, but when he talks
you'd be smart to listen.

<li>Ralph Johnson - another of the Gang of Four, Ralph's been involved
in many cool things including Smalltalk, design patterns, and
automated refactoring tools.

<li>Ward Cunningham - The list of Ward's contributions seems to be
endless sometimes.  Called <i>"The best programmer I know"</i> by
Kent Beck.  Some of the things that Ward's been involved in include:
design patterns, Smalltalk, refactoring, test-first programming,
automated testing, and wiki.

<li>Yukihiro Matsumoto - better known as Matz... creator of the Ruby
programming language.

</li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>

And that's just a sampling.  The only other conference I know of that
has a line up approaching that quality is OOPSLA.. but JAOO was only
~600 people.. not several thousand.. so there was the chance for attendees to
interact with the speakers.

<h1>Saturday, Sept 20</h1>
<p>Due to hurricane Isabel, my travel plans were reshuffled a
bit... I wasn't able to make it back to Virginia between conferences
(luckily I always overpack slightly).  Rather than leaving Boston
Thursday evening and flying to Newark Friday night (and then on to
Copenhagen) I flew direct from Boston to Newark Friday evening.  It
took a while for the Continental folks at Logan airport to straighten
out my itinerary change, but in the end all was well and I was off.

<p>First to Newark, where I had 4 hours to occupy myself.  The trip
between terminals took a little, but there wasn't much else to do
between 9pm and midnight.  A snack and a pint at the Sam Adams pub,
and watching CNN was about it.  Finally it was time to board.  I had a
great seat.  Exit row behind a bulkhead.  A missing row of seats to
accommodate the exit.. so more leg room than I could use.  That and
personal screen and a selection of movies made the flight quite comfortable.

<p>In Copenhagen, I had a very tight connection to the local carrier that
flew to Aarhus.  After I asked around, I found that the domestic
terminal was at the far end of the terminal complex... a kilometre or
so away.  On a good day it would have been a nice walk... but there
was a bus, so I opted for that.  I managed to get to the proper gate
with a few minutes to spare.

<p>I arrived in Aarhus shortly thereafter... Denmark is a remarkably
small country.  Not knowing anything about the local travel
arrangement or even exactly where (other than the hotel name: <i>The
Cab Inn</i>) in town I was headed.. I grabbed a taxi and was taken
directly to the hotel.  A word to the wise: The trip from the airport
to Aarhus was on the pricy side (somewhere around 500
DKK).... somewhere around twice the cost of a comparable ride in the
US.

<p><a href="../_/http/www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.html$/&amp;collid=15742089605&amp;photoid=26742089605.html"><img align="right" src="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/images/dastels/canal-160.jpg"/></a>

After settling into my hotel cell.. ahh.. room (yes it was
small.. but overall adequate to the purpose) and freshening up I had
some dinner at <i>Cafe Faust</i> (below and connected to the hotel).
It was a nice meal and I sat at a table that was open to outside with
a view of the canal.

<p>Following that I took a short walk and returned to my room to sleep
off the effects of the overnight flight.

<h1>Sunday, Sept 21</h1>
<p>I was up and out by 11:00 to be greeted by a rather cool and rainy
morning.  I had a great brunch, again at <i>Cafe Faust</i>.  By the
time I had finished that the rain had stopped, the sun had come out,
and the streets were drying.

<p>I spent the afternoon wandering around town with the aid of a small
map provided by the hotel.  My first goal was to find the conference
location.  Which I did before long.  That done I wandered more or less
aimlessly for the remainder of the afternoon.

<p> <a href="../_/http/www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.html$/&amp;collid=15742089605&amp;photoid=45742089605.html"><img align="left" src="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/images/dastels/bike-lane-160.jpg"/></a>
<a href="../_/http/www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.html$/collid=15742089605&amp;photoid=65742089605.html"><img align="left" src="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/images/dastels/bike-ramp-160.jpg"/></a>

Aarhus is a very bicycle-friendly city.  Along most streets there
are bike lanes.  These are often not part of the street surface:
there's a curb between the street &amp; the bike lane, then another curb
between it and the sidewalk.  At larger intersections the bike lanes
even have turn lanes marked. In the photos here, you can see the bike lane between the street &amp; sidewalk and bike ramps alongside stairs.


<p><a href="../_/http/www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.html$/&amp;collid=15742089605&amp;photoid=77742089605.html"><img align="right" src="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/images/dastels/sondergade-160.jpg"/></a>

The city is incredibly pedestrian friendly as well, with many
people walking.  In the old part of the city, there is a network of
pedestrian-only streets.  The main one is a shopping street called
Sondergade (yes... that <b>is</b> <i>McDonald's</i> you see in the background).

<p>Then dinner at a cafe along the canal followed by prep for my
tutorials on Friday.

<h1>Monday, Sept. 22</h1>
<p>I had a quick breakfast at the hotel before heading to the
conference.  After Danish breakfast for a couple days, I have a firm
preference for a Southern European breakfast.  Thankfully, that's what
they were serving at the conference: Coffee, croissants, &amp; brioche.

<p>Having gotten to the conference site, I registered (basically picking
up my attendee package and badge.  I checked over the program and
decided what I wanted to see and checked my email in the <i>Net
Cafe</i> hosted by Sun.  Then I had a bit of time to wander about
before meeting with an Acquisitions Editor from Wiley.

<p>Then it was time for coffee, and to wander the exhibit hall.  The
last morning session let out and Bill Venners (Bill runs <a href="../_/http/www.artima.com">artima.com</a>) came by and we went off to
have lunch together.  [BTW I thought lunches were quite nice, and
according to some Danes that I asked, quite traditional].  After a
bit, Dave Thomas joined us.

<p>After lunch I saw Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt give their <i>How to
Keep Your Job</i> talk.  I already knew the content, but it was
entertaining to hear them deliver it and it gave me a chance to
finally meet Andy.

<p>The core of their talk was to treat your career like an investment
portfolio... invest, diversify, balance, etc.

<p>You can see their presentation on the Pragmatic Programmer site.

<p>Next up was Bo Leuf talking on <i>Wiki and Agile Security
Methods</i>.  

Bo's presentation was done with a set of wiki pages which you can find on his site.

<p>At the break I wandered back to the cafe are for more coffee and ran
into Alan Knight (of Cincom, and organiser of this year's <i>Smalltalk
Solutions</i> conference).  Alan and I had a good talk and by the time
we parted company, the next session had begun so I stayed and chatted
with the rep from Libelis, who make an JDO implementation.

<p>I made it to the next session: <i>Amplifying the Agile
Principles</i> by Jutta Eckstein &amp; Nikolai Josuttis (whose book on the
standard C++ library I bought at the conference).

<p>Then it was time for the keynote by Ole Lehrmann Madsen of the
University of Aarhus.  Madsen was a student of Kristen Nygaard (a
co-inventor of OO and Simula-67).  The talk was called <i>The
Scandinavian School of Object-Orientation - in memory of Ole-Johan
Dahl and Kristen Nygaard</i>.  This was, I thought, a very interesting
talk.  It gave insight into one of the creators of the way many of us
program.

<p>After a short trip back to the hotel to pick up my laundry, shower &amp;
change, it was off to the party!  There was a guy I noticed in several
talks throughout the day who was wearing a <i>RadSoft</i> Tshirt.
[RadSoft is a custom programming shop that uses XP, based in Idaho.
They were giving away Tshirt like the one this guy was wearing at
XPAU.]  I noticed him at a table with a few other and invited myself
to join them.  It turns out that he had been at XPAU, and his team
(who were sitting with him) have been using XP for about a year.  We
had a great evening talking about various things... mostly centred
around XP.

<p>The party was a blast.  The beer flowed freely, with the corporate
sponsors showing their generosity by buying rounds for the assembled
host.  Apparently this is a JAOO tradition.. and a fine tradition it
is.  I have no idea how may beers came and went at our table, but the
only one that I had to pay for was the first.  The organisers of XPAU
(oh.. I am one this year) could learn a few things about throwing a
party from the Danes!.. or from the Italians, based on what memories I
have of the party at XP2002.

<h1>Tuesday, Sept. 23</h1>
<h2>Extending Eclipse</h2>
<p><a href="../_/http/www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.html$/&amp;collid=15742089605&amp;photoid=66742089605.html"><img align="right" src="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/images/dastels/erich-ralph-160.jpg"/></a>

Breakfast at the conference cafe, and then to the <i>Hangover
Keynote</i>, as it was described by the main speaker: Erich Gamma.
Erich gave an overview and demonstration of the plugin architecture
and capabilities of Eclipse.  Then Ivo Totev of SAP discussed how
they've extended Eclipse. Here's a nice shot of Erich with another of the GoF, Ralph Johnson.

<h2>Martin Fowler</h2>
<p>After coffee, it was Martin Fowler's turn with <i>Software Design
in the 21st Century</i>.  Martin's talk centred around a paper he
wrote that was published in the Sept/Oct 2003 issue of IEEE Software.
I had just read the article in the last week, but (as with Dave &amp;
Andy) it was enjoyable hearing Martin deliver the content.  And
besides Martin's a good speaker and always enjoyable to listen to.

<p>Some points from the talk:

<ul>
<li>architecture is the things in a system that are important to
whoever is defining what the architecture is

<li>architecture is <i>puffed-up</i> design, which means that
architects are <i>puffed-up</i> designers

<li>get rid of architecture if possible

<li>there are two species of architects:

<ol>
<li><i>Architectus Reloadus</i> - as exemplified in the movie
<i>Matrix Reloaded</i>: the one who makes all the important decisions.

<li><i>Architectus Oryzus</i> - as exemplified by Martin's coworker,
Dave Rice: knows what's going on, looking out for problems before they
get serious, and collaborating intensely with everyone else on the
team.. including mentoring more junior members.  

</li></li></ol>

The talk then turned to three types of <b>drivens</b> that are being
talked about these days:

<ol>
<li>Model Driven Architecture
<ul>
<li>UML as a programming language
<li>will only succeed if it's more productive
<li>not likely to succeed
</li></li></li></ul>
<li>Test Driven Development
<ul>
<li>greater pickup than XP
<li>evolutionary design
<li>inherently plays to the <i>Architectus Oryzus</i> style of

architect.
<li>refactoring avoids having a well tested <i>big ball of mud</i>
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<li>Domain Driven Design

<ul>
<li>see the book of the same name by Eric Evans
<li>how do you build OO domain models and let them drive development
<li>if you're going to build a system, start with a model of the
domain
<li>works well with TDD
<li>diverges from TDD where it talks about building a conceptual model
of the domain
<li>ubiquitous language (this is somewhat akin to the idea of
<i>metaphor</i> in XP)
</li></li></li></li></li></li></ul>
</li></li></li></ol>
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<h2>Lunch</h2>
<p>I ran into Mike Hill on my way to grab a quick lunch.  I had said I'd
make myself available to sign books for Pearson, but I needed lunch
first.  Mike was on his way to lunch as well so we ate together and
had a good catch-up chat.

<p>Then off to the book signing.  There was little interest
actually.... which was a little disappointing (no.. not just
me.. no-one was doing much signing).  I had the pleasure of standing
between Martin Fowler and Bjarne Stroustrup.  I have to admit that it
does feel a little overwhelming at times to be counted in amongst
people I was reading when I was learning OO... I still remember
devouring the first edition of <i>The C++ Programming Language</i>.
It was a bit of a thrill to buy a copy of the third edition this week and
get it signed by Stroustrup himself.

<h2>Bjarne Stroustrup</h2>
<p>After lunch, Bjarne Stroustrup talked on the standardisation of C++.
This was an interesting talk... not so much due to the subject... but
rather for the opportunity to here C++ talked about by it's creator.
I finally made the decision to brush off my C++ skills and learn the
standard library (which was just coming out when I last used C++ any
amount).  I had been considering this for some time as we get queries
from more &amp; more C++ shops.

<h2>Kent Beck</h2>
<p>Next up was Kent Beck.  Kent's talk was started in a bar in New
Orleans during XPAU in August.  At the conference dinner at XPAU, Bob
Martin talked about XP's values and practises.  In response to some
who say that the values are the important thing, and that you can use
any practises that embody your values, Bob insisted that the practises
were crucial.  Kent's response: "Wrong answer".

<p>So then, what does Kent think is the crucial thing?  The
principles.  Why?  Here's my notes from the talk.

<p>Everyone decides every day how they will do their work that day.
What will it be?

<ul>
<li>exactly like yesterday?
<li>totally different from yesterday?
<li>follow the latest trend?
<li>or maybe... <b>think about it and decide</b>?
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Ok, but what tools do you have to think about how you work?

<ol>
<li>Values
<li>Principles
<li>Practises
</li></li></li></ol>
<p>What are these things?

<p><b>Values</b>
<p>These are the things you hold dear.Everyone has their own list of
values... and so does every community.  The list of values in the
whitebook (<i>eXtreme Programming Explained</i>) was where Kent was in
1996.  His comment was that he has a different list now.

<p><b>Practises</b>
<p>These are specific things that you do.

<p>Values are vague and nebulous while practises are cut &amp;
dried... very concrete.  For example: <i>"When you wrote that were you
holding communication dear?"</i> versus <i>"when you wrote that were you
pair programming?"</i>
<p>Practises are particular to the context and domain.  Values are
more universal.

<p>Values provide purpose to the practises (e.g. we pair program
because we value communication) while practises bring accountability
to the values.

<p><b>Principles</b>
<p>Principles are needed when there's stress, when you're down, etc.
It's easy to do the right thing when everything is going well... you
don't need principle then.

<p>If one of your values is confidence (i.e. having confidence is
important to you) and you have some really hairy code to write.  If
you have the principle of <i>double checking</i> you can use the
practise of writing a test (and in a sense say the same thing twice as
a check: once in the test and once in the code) or you could use the
practise of pair programming (and have someone else there to check
your work).

<p>Principles ...

<ul>
<li>bridge values to practises in a specific situation
<li>are value laden and context specific
<li>are a translation from values to practises
<li>apply at various levels of scale, e.g. for the principle of confidence:
<ul>
<li>one programmer - write tests
<li>two programmers - pair programming
<li>team - continuous integration
<li>project - customer tests
</li></li></li></li></ul>
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Kent wrapped up his talk by talking about <i>scale free
networks</i>.  This is a class of networks having the property that if
you graph the number of incoming or outgoing connections against the
number of nodes having that count, you get a linear plot with many
nodes having a low number of connection and few having a high number.
The few nodes having a high number of connections are called hubs.
The capacity of the network is limited by the connectedness of the
biggest hub.

<p>An example of this is an airplane flight network.  Heathrow is the
most connected hub.  To increase the global capacity of the airline
industry, you just have to add more connection to/from Heathrow.

<p>OK.. so what.  What's that have to do with programming?  Well,
consider people in a team.  The connections are their interactions
with other members of the team... the highly interacting people are
the hubs: the leads, analysts, architects (good ones anyway), etc.
How do we get more communication within teams... bring back (or
increase the involvement of) the hubs.

<p>Kent closed with an experiment:  Give all team members a card.
Have them note on it everything they talk to another team member over
a set period of time (day, month, etc).  Kent expects the result to be
a scale free network.

<p>Here's Kent (centre) and Martin (right), talking with Doug Lea:

<p><a href="../_/http/www.ofoto.com/PhotoView.html$/&amp;collid=15742089605&amp;photoid=46742089605.html"><img src="../_/http/www.artima.com/weblogs/images/dastels/doug-kent-martin-160.jpg"/></a>
<p><b>Eclipse again</b>
<p>After the break it was back to hear Erich Gamma talk more about
Eclipse.

<h2>Buffet at City Hall</h2>
<p>In the evening there was a buffet and networking event at City Hall.
It was a pleasant affair.  I had the pleasure of meeting Pawel
Wielgus, a student in Poland.

<h1>Wednesday, Sept 24</h1>
<p>The day started with Robin Roos talking about object modelling using
<i>The Domain Neutral Component</i> (DNC) (by Peter Coad et.al.) and
collaboration patterns as put forth in <i>Streamlined Object
Modelling</i>.  Robin had some interesting things to say, but overall I
found it to be overkill.  As an advocate and practitioner of eXtreme
Programming I found the result of Robin's exercise to be overly
complex and speculative.  To me it pointed out one of the main dangers
of a classic big-design-up-front (BDUF) approach.  In terms of the use
of the DNC, Palmer went on in one of his code letter issues (see
bdn.borland.com) that the DNC is a starting point and isn't to be used
in it's entirety in every context.  When the full generality is not
required, classes should be combined (e.g. Person &amp; Role, Item &amp;
Description).  Robin has some good things to say about EJB, and I
fully agree with his views on that matter, but his model centric,
speculative approach to programming is at the heart of what I (and
other XP &amp; Agile supporters) are actively fighting against.  Vive la
revolution!

<p>There was nothing in the second session that I was particularly
eager to see, so I made use of the time to catch up on some email.

<h2>Ward Cunningham</h2>
<p>Then it was time to go hear/see Ward Cunningham talk.  Who
introduced Ward escapes me now, but he got it right: <i>"Born
inventor.  Born teacher.  Patient, wise, and kind."</i>  The only
change I'd make is to replace <i>teacher</i> with <i>mentor</i>.

<p>Ward started by talking a bit about what he's been up to lately:

<ul>
<li>little machines
<li>entrepreneurial version of XP
<li>the agile testing community
<li>coaching developers
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Then he talked a bit about exploratory testing, citing books by
Brian Marick and Bruce Petticord.  While XP lets programmers think,
exploratory testing lets testers think.

<p>Ward shared an epiphany he had recently:

<ul>
<li>we each have to be good at something
<li>that something has to do with the future.
</li></li></ul>
<p>Some things to be good at include:

<ul>
<li>reasoning about the future
<li>systematically exploring
<li>speculatively investing in the future
</li></li></li></ul>
<p>See <a href="../_/http/c2.com/cgi/wiki$/WeShouldBeGoodAtThis/index.html">the wiki</a> for
more.

<p>Ward proceeded to show us some tools that he's written that let him
explore things about the files he has.  And he gave a quick look at
Fit (see <a href="../_/http/fit.c2.com">fit.c2.com</a>.

<p>Here's a few interesting comments I noted from the talk:

<ul>
<li>Trust comes from simplicity.
<li>Everyone should write a web server just to see what it's like.
<li>I couldn't find a server that wasn't overly complex... so I wrote
my own.
</li></li></li></ul>
<h2>Pairing with Ward</h2>
<p>After lunch I was heading up to listen to Linda Rising and Daniel May
talk when I ran into Ward on the stairs.  We chatted briefly about his
talk.  Then he says "So, how's that Smalltalk port of Fit doing?".
Ahem.. ah.. umm... "I haven't gotten time to work on it since April."
say I somewhat sheepishly.  "You got it with you?".  "Yes," says I,
"it's on my laptop that's in my pack." (that's on my back).  "You got
time?  You want to pair on it some?"  Duh!  "Well, I was on my way to
a couple talks... but nothing that important!"  So we grabbed a table
in the cafe area and I brought up my latest Fit image.  We worked away
for a couple hours and made some real progress.  As the last electrons
faded away from my battery (silly me neglected to bring the power
adaptor) Matz came over and the three of us proceeded to discuss the
question of what is a scripting language.  It was very interesting.
Ward nailed it nicely by proposing that scripting is a style of
programming and not a characteristic of a specific language.  Can you
write real programs (as opposed to scripts) in Python or Ruby?
Sure... if you go about it the right way (e.g. using TDD and/or XP).
Some languages (e.g. Python, Perl, Ruby) support the scripting style
more than others (e.g. Java, C++).  I see Smalltalk being good at
both.  You can write solid, enterprise level applications using solid
practises and you can also bash out quick scripts in the workspace.

<p>So not only did I have a chance to hang out and chat with Ward, but
I got to pair with him (in Smalltalk even).  When I related this
little story to Mike Hill (who's known Ward &amp; Kent for some time), he
(with some incredulity) said something much like "What!? You were
invited to pair by Ward!  Cool!"  Ya.. cool.


<h2>Kevlin Henny</h2>
<p>Kevlin closed the conference with a keynote titled <i>Beyond
Metaphor</i>.  No, not the XP metaphor.. rather the metaphors used to
describe software development.

<p>Kevlin started off by stating the obvious.. "Metaphor is not the
thing itself", but that we use metaphor to the point of not noticing
it... so we run the risk of interpreting metaphors more literally than
we should.

<p>Next he took us on a survey of the common metaphors used for
software development.

<p><b>Engineering</b>
<p>Personally this is the one I have the most problems with, but I'm
here to talk about what Kevlin said.. sooo...

<p>This was originally used to mock software developers.  Just like
"The Big Bang Theory" was original used to make fun of that theory of
the beginning of the universe... "What? It just got created with a big
bang?"

<p>Engineering works in physical space... software does not.

<p>The only that really is the same between physical space and
software is the 2nd law of thermodynamics: entropy... or put simply:
things get messier.

<p>Software is mathematical, but it's not mathematics.

<p>If we consider all engineering disciplines to be siblings, then
software definitely doesn't fit.  However if we divide engineering
into physical (e.g. electrical, mechanical) and informational
(e.g. software) then it fits better.  Software becomes a cousin of
physical engineering, not a sibling.

<p><b>Architecture</b>
<p>OK, what about architecture.. I mean we have software architects?
Architecture addresses an aspect of software development, but not it's
whole.  Architecture is all about master planning.. designing it up
front.  That simply doesn't work with software (despite what agile
opponents might say... they're either in denial or are delusional).
Software requires an evolutionary, piecemeal growth oriented approach.

<p>OK, so not architecture... what about

<p><b>Craft</b>
<p>Ok.. craft.. I'm big on this one.  First of all, it's not mutually
exclusive with either architecture or engineering.  Software shares
several features with Craft:

<ul>
<li>emphasis on skill &amp; creativity
<li>pride in work
<li>individuals and small teams
<li>learning from failure
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Some say that something is craft because it's immature.
Not so.  Craft is what it is because it comes from the skill and role
of he individual, not because it's an immature discipline.

<p>Kelvin went on to warn that the history of craftsmanship is not all
rosy.  Craft Guilds were brutal and exploitive.  Not everything that
was made was of high quality.  When we think of craftsmanship we think
of products that have survived the ravages of time.  But that's
self selective... the only things that have survived to the present
were the products that were well made.  That doesn't mean that many
were not made well... it just means that they didn't make it to the
present.

<p><b>Composing</b>
<p>Finally... is software like composition (literary or musical)?
Maybe.. style certainly has a strong role, software has close
parallels to technical writing.

<p>Consider how music scales with the number of people involved:

<ul>
<li>playing solo
<li>jamming with someone else
<li>playing in a band
<li>being part of an orchestra
</li></li></li></li></ul>
<p>Each increase in scope requires an increase in planning and
formality... just like software development.

<h2>The speaker dinner</h2>
<p>So after freshening up &amp; a change into something a little more dressy
(those that know me well know that "a little more dressy" means
dockers rather than jeans) we load into a bus and have a tour of
Aarhus, narrated by Mette (one of the absolutely delightful ladies
running the show) with Bjarne Stroustrup taking over for the loop
through The University of Aarhus grounds.  We ended up a the
restaurant at the Marina (anyone know the name?).

<p>I had the great pleasure of sitting with a great set of dinner
companions: Steve Vinoski (who did lots of CORBA work with IONA),
Bjarne Stroustrup, Kelvin Henny, Jos Warmer, Bill Venners, and ???
(help me out).  What great dinner company.  The food was great, the
wine was freely flowing.  It must have been some magically combination
of all of that, but between us we came up with a potential event for
next year: The Ultimate Panel (aka The Panel at the end of the
Universe): a 42 hour long panel (running around the clock) that will
attempt to answer the questions of life, the universe, and everything
software related.

<p>And here's some photos: Matz &amp; Bjarne Stroustrup, Kelvin Henley and Jos Warmer, Bill Venners, and Mike Hill.

<p>The meal was great, the crowd was great.  Everyone appeared to have
a good time.  OK.. it was time to leave (about midnight)... the bus
was, of course, long gone having done it's duty in getting us there.
OK.. Aarhus is a small town... we can walk.  Mike Hill was up to full
Americana form and took a bit of convincing but he eventually joined
us.  We got back to the canal (and the Cab Inn) about 1:00 am.  Mike
hadn't been there before and was heading for the Radison (the
conference hotel).  I was feeling wide awake from the walk so I
offered to guide him.  We arrived at the hotel about 15 minutes later.
Hmm... the bar's full.. must be still open.  Well, the short story is
that we decided to have a drink or two before calling it a night.
About 3 am Ward, Bjarne, &amp; Brian Foote wandered in.  Ward noticed us
at the bar and he &amp; Brian joined us for a drink.  The barkeep (Per)
impressed upon us the importance of having a shot of Aquavit (kept in
the freezer, it still poured like light syrup).  Ward &amp; Brian hung
about for a short while talking before heading off.  Mike &amp; I finally
called it a (increasingly misnamed) night about 6:20.  I went back to
my hotel, and after a couple hours sleep and a shower headed back to
the conference centre and the XP workshop.

<h1>Thursday, Sept 25</h1>
<p>OK, it's been Thursday for a while by now.

<p>I spent the day in a workshop for local XP practitioners with
Ward.  It went very well.

<p>In the evening another bus took us to the Steno Museum on the
university campus (a museum of science and medicine).

<p>Chili John was in fine form again (he catered the party as well) and provided a wonder meal.

<p>As Mike &amp; I both had a full day tutorial on Friday, we cut out
early to get a good night's sleep in preparation.

<h1>Friday, Sept 26</h1>
<p>I was teaching TDD tutorials all day today.  It went very well
overall.  Several people told me they enjoyed it and learnt
something that will help them in their work.  What more can you hope
for.

<p>To debrief from the day, Mike &amp; I had a relaxing beer and headed
into town to have dinner at a cafe along the canal, then back to the
bar to talk business for a while.  Martin Fowler joined us after a
short while.  I left shortly after that to get ready for an early
morning.

<h1>Saturday, Sept 27</h1>
<p>All things come to an end, and so must this trip.  I shared the ride
to the airport with a couple young programmers from Belgium.  We
parted ways in the Copenhagen airport.  In the gate area for my flight
back to D.C. I met up with Dave Tomas, Andy Hunt, and Martin Fowler
who were on the same flight.

<p>A long flight, but pleasant enough.  And now I'm home again in
Northern Virginia.  But I'll be back at JAOO next year!

<p>Dave
