<p>
Recently my wife and I were discussing the next few years, including what kinds of work I'd be taking on after 

my current stint: I'm currently splitting my time between helping a client's team redevelop a successful, but 

aging, data manipulation product to be able to handle data sets up to 4 orders of magnitude larger that it can 

currently manage, and working on my next book(s). Both activities are highly demanding, very rewarding, and 

probably going to complete early next year. Lucky me! ;-)
</p>
<p>
After that, my current (modest) plan is to do some hard-core consulting to the banking and finance industry here 

in Aus, hopefully helping them to boost the performance of their trading systems by substantial amounts. 

(Working on high-performance high-robustness networking systems is what most whets my development appetite.)
</p>
<p>
But after that, perhaps towards the end of next year, I said I'd like to take on a new development team, but do 

so on my terms. (These terms will be explained in a moment.) Having just come out of a position of being 

involved in the management of a development team in a struggling organisation, with all the stresses that that 

entails, my wife naturally enquired as to why I'd consider going back to that. She makes a good point, because 

it was a hell of a cat-herding, management-juggling, technology-obviating 18 months. (Helping developers to 

learn and improve is what most whets my managerial appetite.)
</p>
<p>
The question of why I'd like to try it again - after my product redesigning, book writing, bank optimising, 

library releasing fun in between - boils down to what I have lamely termed down the years (in conversational 

rants on the subject with anyone who'd listen): the <b>Equine Management</b> question. A friend recently 

suggested that I put it down on electrons somewhere, so here goes. Please come along for the gallop ...
</p>
<h2>Equine Management</h2>
<p>
In <a href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month/index.html">The Mythical Man-Month</a>, <a href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks/index.html">Fred Brooks</a> comments  on studies showing that within groups 

of <i>experienced, competent developers</i> there can be <b>productivity differences of up to 1000%</b>. 

Furthermore, the quality of the produced software can have similar disparities. Brooks comments that software 

produced by <i>experienced, competent developers</i> can have <b>performance differences of up to 500%</b>.
</p>
<p>
From personal experience, I can certainly say that I've experienced groups of developers with productity and 

quality - not that software performance is the only, or even the most important, measure of quality - ranges at 

least as large as this. Where I would demur - again, based on personal experience - is in stipulating that the 

large ranges encompassed "experienced, competent developers". (Again, more of this in a moment.)
</p>
<p>
Being keenly drawn to simplicity in managing life, I am given to applying deductive reasonsing from facts to reach

conclusions regarding human behaviour. In this case, I believe that the critical role of any software 

development manager is to ensure that his/her development team is populated with individuals who are towards the 

upper end of the performance range. This may be achieved by a variety of means including, but not limited to, 

recruitment, education, and mentoring. But that's just the tip of the ice-berg. Crucially, having a team 

populated with high-performing individuals is no more permanent than the optimal conditioning range of the 

musculature/brain/aerobic-system/etc. of an elite athlete. As soon as you allow it to, it will erode. Being a 

developer who is capable of inhabiting the upper bands of these metrics, I am all too aware from experience how 

easy it is to fall down the ratings, through fatigue, bad management, lack of appreciation (more often peer approval, 

though money is a factor) and boredom.
</p>
<h2>Racehorse Management</h2>
<p>
What I call the <b>Racehorse Model of Development Management</b> recognises the wide range of possible 

performance of software developers and the concomitant opportunity for an organisation to prosper, and attempts 

to give them the best possible circumstances within which to produce at their best. Given that software costs 

are a significant factor in (almost?) all software development organisations, dramatic increases of the order of 

100-1000% are to be sought, and valued, most highly.
</p>
<p>
Racehorses get the best hay, they get to come in at night, they get the best medical care, they are brushed, 

massaged, trimmed, cosseted in all manner of ways. But on race day they have to run. Very, very fast. And when 

they're old and past-in they're sent off to stud, where they can "pass on" their abilities so that the next 

generation can go even faster.
</p>
<h2>Carthorse Management</h2>
<p>
The converse approach I call the <b>Carthorse Model of Development Management</b>. Carthorses are 

(comparatively) big lumbering beasts tasked with pulling big loads on slow carts. They aren't cosseted, groomed, 

massaged, and they don't get to eat Marks &amp; Spencers imported New Zealand carrots peeled by albino virgins 

with diamond knives. And, worst of all, nobody expects them to get their job done with any speed or grace.
</p>
<p>
Carthorse managers don't bother too much about the working conditions of their developers. They fuss about a 

developer being in the office between the hours and 9 and 5, and yet won't provide these developers with extended 

periods protected from interruptions (and that includes <i>meetings</i>!) during their day that would allow them 

to actually be productive, as opposed to just being present. They wouldn't dream of offering the developers a 

day at home to research a new technology/language, just in case it "might look bad". They don't battle for 

better conditions for their developers because they simply don't understand that better conditions will lead to 

productivity increases orders-of-magnitude greater than preventing them from having access to the internet just 

to stop the occasional email to their friends
</p>
<p>
I've encountered Carthorse managers many times in my consulting career - in my earlier, salaried career, I 

didn't identify them as such; they were just people whose inexplicably arbitrary interference I detested - and 

in my experience they fall into two camps. Either they're people who've never been software developers, and 

simply don't get it: it's kind of like putting an accountant in charge of a school or hospital (or a software 

developer in charge of a football team). Alternatively, they're software developers who, by dint of personality or 

immaturity, have poor social skills and are often paranoid about subordinates outshining them. In both cases, 

one wonders why they have been put in that position. Like as not, it's a manifestation of the <a href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle/index.html">Peter Principle</a>, whereby (usually) smart, talented 

people are promoted one step beyond their competence. And once there, there's no going back.
</p>
<p>
The best thing one can do for such people is to buy them a copies of <a href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month/index.html">The Mythical Man-Month</a> and <a href="../_/http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware/index.html">PeopleWare</a>
and cross one's fingers. The best thing for any racehorses that find themselves being
managed in such a way is to find another position, before you find yourself wearing a harness
pulling a big cart!
</p>
<h2>Wild-Horse Management</h2>
<p>
Before I (briefly) outline the characteristics of racehorse management, I would observe that there's a third, 

accidental, school of development management: <b>Wild-horse Management of Software Development</b> (a term 

recently confected). Such teams tend to be subject to ad-hoc management, often under managers that have other 

responsibilities. Some may be geographically diverse. Some I've encountered had developed within companies whose 

main activities are outside software development; others where the founding software developer has become CEO, 

CIO and chief cook and bottle-washer, leaving the team to fend for themselves.
</p>
<p>
Where
 racehorse management (if done well) will tend to produce outstanding results, and carthorse management 

will tend to produce very average results, companies utilising wild-horse management may vary wildly in how well 

they produce software. I suspect this is due to the differences between potentially highly productive developers 

when left to their own devices: some will perform highly in isolation, others may flounder for lack of contact, 

intellectual exchange, and recognition/affirmation.
</p>
<p>
In my personal opinion, wild-horse teams need to evolve - hopefully to racehorse teams - to really achieve. If 

you fail to start their evolution in that direction, you may find that they dissipate entirely or, equally 

undesirable, someone else in the organisation will force-evolve them into carthorse.
</p>
<h2>Applying Racehorse Management</h2>
<p>
So what exactly is <b>Racehorse Management</b>. Well, I'm not sure exactly. Since this is as yet a personal 

model, and this is the first time it's been given <i>any</i> kind of write-up, it's more of a case that I know 

it when I see it. However, there are some defining characteristics that can be stipulated now:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Motivation</b> Developer performance is valued more highly than automated performance. Sure, a new design 

tool might bring productivity increases of 10-100%. But correctly motivating your developers can bring increases 

that may be an order of magnitude more significant.
 </li>
<li>
<b>Quality is valued</b> All aspects of software quality - robustness, correctness, discoverability &amp; 

transparency, efficiency, expressiveness, flexibility, modularity and portability - are valued. The software 

produced by such teams may be said to be beautiful.
 </li>
<li>
<b>Team Spirit is valued</b> Racehorse teams enjoy high levels of team spirit. Note: this doesn't always mean 

that they have deep affection for their employer - though they will always have more positive feelings than 

negative - but they will have it for their team.
 </li>
<li>
<b>Discussion is valued</b> In racehorse teams, developers have regular debates about technology and practices. 

They challenge each other, including their manager(s).
 </li>
<li>
<b>Down-time and research is valued</b> In racehorse teams, developers have time to spend reading on tangential 

matters, and doing research.
 </li>
<li>
<b>The managers and team leads are humble</b> Managers and team-leads of racehorse teams are not ignorantly 

autocratic. They respect the talents and experience of each team member. By the same token, they are not afraid 

to lead in the technical areas in which they are superior.
 </li>
<li>
<b>Work smart</b> Racehorse teams use modern development practices, and automate their work as much as 

possible, in order to concentrate on using their very expensive greyware for the things that computers can't do.
 </li>
<li>
<b>Compensation</b> It almost goes without saying that, if developers' productivity is several times higher 

than the average, they will be paid substantially more than market rate.
 </li>
<li>
<b>Aptitude is the key</b> Ludicrous notions that old/female/badly-dressed/differently-accented people cannot
  write beautiful software find no home in race-horse teams.
<!--
Speaking personally, the older I get the better my
  brain works (adding wisdom and habit to raw intelligence is a pretty heady mix), as evinced by my recent
  contributions to the open source world. Although I've not worked with that many great female software developers,
  one or two of the best I've worked with have been female. (If you care to think about it this way, most of the
  bad software developers I've encountered have been male.) Same deal with race. And with dress-sense. (Bet you
  can count on one hand the number of "cool" developers you've worked with.)
-->
</li>
<li>
<b>Development is respected</b> In racehorse organisations, the development team is not seen as the socially-

inadequate grease-monkeys of the organisation (even when they are socially inadequate). Software development is 

respected for the pivotal role it has in the overall success of the organiation.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>They shoot horses, don't they!?</h2>
<p>
All the foregoing might seem relatively obvious for any modern team. However, there's one final aspect that 

we've not covered, and which you may be wondering about. It's one that I deem as essential to the model. If a 

developer is consistently, and irretrievably, under-performing, you have to be able to expel them from the 

organisation. And not with months of "performance management" and all that (mutually) soul-destroying rigmarole.
Of course, this should not be done without consideration or compassion, but it has to be done. Slow race horses win no races, but they still eat hay.
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
In summary, I shall defer to far greater experts than I, the authors of PeopleWare, Marco and Lister, who say 

(from PeopleWare, of course): "<i>a manager's job is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people 

to work</i>".
</p>
<h2>And for me?</h2>
<p>
Well, I'm a realist. I know that there are precious few organisations here in Australia with the foresight, the 

scale and the finances to create truly world-class teams on the basis outlined in this article (and that 

includes the ability to easily get rid of irretrievably underperforming developers). However, if any come 

knocking on my door next year wanting to build world-beating software, I'll let you know how it goes.
