<p>
I was doing so well. I had resolved to blog more often, and had
done a pretty good job of not waiting until I had polished my thoughts before
pushing them out to the web. And a pretty interesting discussion had ensued,
around notions of typing, mobile code, and how to use Java for distributed
computing.</p>

    But then I got a piece of email from one of my compatriots,
    and I hit a wall. It wasn't complex, or hard to understand, or even all
    that provocative (at least, I don't think it was meant to be). It made a
    simple statement: <i>Of course, next you will talk about the role of XML
    in all this</i>. And because of that little statement, I hit a wall, and
    have been silent for months.

    But the time has come to face the demons and answer the
    question. Let me tell you what I think the role of XML is going to be in
    all this...or at least start what will no doubt be a series of posts
    trying to make it clear what I think of XML, what I think the role of XML
    should be, and other assorted subjects.

    Those of you who know me, or have heard me speak, or have
    read some of what I have written in the past, may have the impression that
    I don't think much of XML. There is a sense in which that is true, but
    like so much in this world, the whole story is much more complex than
    that.

    To begin with, I'm never quite sure what people mean when they talk about
    XML. <a href="../_/http/www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/index.html"><span class="s1">XML</span></a> itself is a specification of a syntax for
    documents, and as an extension of the Standard Generalized Markup Language
    (SGML) it is pretty unobjectionable and pretty unremarkable. But getting
    worked up about the syntax is, as <a href="../_/http/www.artima.com/intv/froth.html"><span class="s1">Rob
    Gingell</span></a> is wont to say, about as sensible as getting worked up
    about ascii.

    But I don't think most people, when talking about XML, are just talking
    about the syntax. They talk about XML being self-documenting or
    human-readable. They talk about XML allowing communication between
    distributed objects. And none of these properties are syntactic; they all
    require some kind of semantics. So when people start ascribing semantic
    properties to a syntax, I start wondering what they are talking
    about. Clearly, the term <i>XML</i> has become shorthand for something
    more, something richer, something more, well, meaningful.

    So perhaps what people mean when they talk about XML is actually XML and
    some DTD, or schema, or other interpretation that will give some semantics
    to go along with syntax. This combination would give some of the
    properties of XML that people talk about. It would allow inter-operation of
    programs that exchanged information using XML (and the common
    interpretation). But then people would need to say what schema, DTD, or
    interpretation they were pairing with XML, because lord knows there are a
    hell of a lot of different standards, pseudo-standards, and proposals that
    use the XML syntax but don't inter-operate.

    The best interpretation I can put on the popularity of XML is that it is
    easy to write a parser for whatever interpretation you want to use, and
    thus there is a simple way to craft a mechanism for passing information
    from one program to another. XML on this view is no different than the use
    of ascii (another syntax) in the early days of Unix. In those days, there
    was a thriving trade in tools that would take ascii streams in and shoot
    ascii streams out. The idea behind all of these tools was that the user of
    the system could string together a sequence of the tools, with each tool
    producing an ascii stream that the next tool would use as input.

    The result was a revolutionary system of simple tools that could be strung
    together to do all sorts of interesting things. Shell languages evolved to
    help program these early services, and a skilled Unix user had a set of
    tools that allowed him (or her) to do all sorts of amazing things. I still
    remember being told that I needed to produce a listing of terms to be
    indexed for a <a href="../_/http/mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp$/ttype=2&amp;tid=6979.asp">book</a>
    I was editing. After a bit of thought, I ran the text of the book through
    <b>tr</b> to get all of the words on a single line, piped the results
    through <b>sort</b> to alphabetize and eliminate duplicates, and then
    edited the resulting word list to get the ones that were significant
    enough to need to be in the index.

    All of these tools worked because the programmers of the tools agreed on a
    syntax for the input and output. You (the user of the tool) needed to make
    sure that the output of one tool could be <i>understood</i> when fed into
    the next tool, but there was no question about the syntactic form for
    output and input. And because the input and output forms were so simple,
    it was easy to construct the tools that would use them. Simplicity in this
    case meant that each tool had to do a fair amount of work in parsing and
    validating the input, but at least there was a common convention for
    passing information from one of the tools to another.

    I think that the attraction of XML is much the same as the attraction of
    ascii... it is a simple way to specify a syntax for exchanging information
    between cooperating programs. Of course, the cooperating programs have to
    be picked in such a way that they can interpret the syntax in the same
    way, so they really have to be developed with a particular interpretation
    in mind. But it is a simple way to enable interaction, and that isn't a
    bad thing.<p>

      But while this understanding makes sense, it also doesn't match all of
      the claims made about the use of XML in distributed computing (or even
      the use of XML in Web Services, yet another phrase that is both
      over-used and seemingly devoid of common meaning). This understanding
      does not insure program interoperability. It doesn't explain the number
      of standards efforts around XML. It doesn't answer many of the problems
      that people say XML answers.<p>

      So I answer the question that started all of this with another
      question. <i>What is the role of XML in all of this?</i> leads to the
      question <i>Just what do you mean by XML?</i>.<p>
