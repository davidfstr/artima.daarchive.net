<p>
<p> I'm sure this will cause me no end of grief, but I'm about to
confess publicly here that I am a heretic.  (In this particular
case I'm only confessing to heresy in computer language design.
Other heresy confessions will have to await another time.)

<p> I'll state it right out: For almost any mature language (C,
Java, C++, Python, Lisp, Ada, FORTRAN, Python, Smalltalk, sh,
javascript, ...) coding style is an essentially solved problem, and
we ought to stop worrying about it.  And to stop worrying about it
will require worrying about it a lot first, because the only way
to get from where we are to a place where we stop worrying about
style is to enforce it <em>as part of the language</em>.

<p> Yup.  I'm really saying that.  I'm saying that, for example,
the next ANSI C update should define the standard K&amp;R
C programming style into the language grammar.  Programs that use
any new features should be required to be in K&amp;R style or be rejected
by the compiler as syntactically illegal.

<p> I'm gonna pause here.  When I was talking about this on a mailing
list I had to go through this several times.  People didn't quite
get me because they didn't quite believe someone was saying this.
I mean this quite literally.  For example, I want the next C grammar
to define that a space comes between any keyword and an opening
parenthesis.  "<tt>if (foo)</tt>" would be legal, but "<tt>if(foo)</tt>"
would not.  Not a warning, not optionally checked, but actually
forbidden by the language parser.  Flat out illegal.  Can't compile.

<p> Here is the logic in its most simple form:

<dl>
<dt><b>Premise 1: For any given language, there are one or a few
    common coding styles.</b>
<dd>Typically one is set by the founder(s) or earliest documenter,
    but others will evolve over time.  But even for C there are only a
    handful of commonly used styles, ignoring trivial variations.

<dt><b>Premise 2: There is not now, nor will there ever be, a
    programming style whose benefit is significantly greater than
    any of the common styles.</b>
<dd>Get real.  Discovering a style that improves your productivity
    or code quality by more than a few percent over the common
    styles is about as likely as discovering a new position for
    sex.   [Astronauts need not apply, unless they want to invite
    me along.]

<dt><b>Premise 3: Approximately a gaboozillion cycles are spent on
    dealing with coding style variations.</b>
<dd>Think about it: How many reformatter/pretty-printers projects
    are there on <a href="../_/http/sf.net/index.html">sourceforge</a> alone?
    How many options does any given IDE (including emacs) have for
    formatting code?  How many cycles are spent deciding on a style,
    documenting it, enforcing it, and updating it?  How many history
    logs for CVS, Clearcase, etc., have a lot of noise from varying
    format changes?  How many brain cycles are spent on arguing
    about this topic?

<dt><b>Premise 4: For any non-trivial project, a common coding style
    is a good thing.</b>
<dd>I really think this is pretty well agreed on.  How constraining
    the style is varies, but having several folks hacking on the same
    code with conflicting coding styles introduces more pain than
    any single style imposes on any single person.  Every project
    I know of has a style, if not spelled out at least by custom.

<dt><b>Conclusion: Thinking of all the code in the entire world as
    a single "project" with a single style, we would get more value
    than we do by allowing for variations in style.</b>
</dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dd></dt></dl>
<p> Think of it.  All the programming examples in one style.  Web
pages, journals, papers, emails use one style.  Reformatting issues
gone.  Arguments over whose style is better gone.  Reformatters a
quaint historical artifact.

<p> And most of all: <em>No More Style Wars!</em>  Really!  Think
of all those cycles that we could then plow into something more
productive, like vi/emacs wars!  Or world peace!  Or a <em>really</em>
good chocolate cookie recipe!  You choose!

<p> Of course, you will never enforce any style globally unless
people have literally no choice.  How many C programmers use
<tt>during</tt> as a stylistic preference to <tt>while</tt>?
(Preprocessor abusers need not apply.  On second thought, please
do: We need to identify you for our eugenics program.)  Or skip the
parens around an <tt>if</tt> clause?  They don't because they
<em>can't.</em> You know they would if they could.  The thing that
stops these "personal styles" is that the C compiler will not accept
them.  If you can't compile your code you fix it.  It's so simple
it's stupid.  And therefore it works.

<p> So I want the owners of standards for established languages to
take this up.  I want the next version of these languages to
require any code that uses new features to conform to some
style.  Let the standards committees gnash and snarl and wring their
hands over which of the common styles is the winner.  Sell tickets.
We all get to comment and the langauge lawyer standards geeks decide.
We know where they'll go -- C will go to K&amp;R C++ will go with
Bjarne's style (excuse me while I cringe); Java will go with the
Sun style as shown in the language spec and most of the Java books
from Sun (including mine); Lisp style is almost already set mostly
in stone.  Perl is a vast swamp of lexical and syntactic swill and
nobody knows how to format even their own code well, but it's the
only major language I can think of (with the possible exception of
the recent, yet very Java-like C#) that doesn't have at least one
style that's good enough.

<p> Some things are either uncheckable (Hungarian notation, using
"get" and "set" method prefixes) or not widely agreed upon (such
as import/#include ordering).  These can be left for future standards.
Or not.  The owners of the the standard decide.  But whatever they
do, they should set the style and build it into the actual freakin'
grammar.

<p> This heresy encompasses one major sub-heresy: That whitespace
should matter.

<p> Most style rules have to do with the placement of whitespace:
newlines before or after curly braces, white space around operators
or not, etc.  So I'm saying that languages should indeed care about
whitespace.  A lot.

Yet one of the things we supposedly learned from languages like
FORTRAN was that whitespace should only matter to separate tokens.
This was accepted wisdom because FORTRAN had columns -- the first
five columns were reserved for a statement number or a comment
indicator, the sixth column with any character in it meant a
continuation of the previous line, seven through 72 where language
statements, and the last eight were reserved for sequence numbers
useful for re-ordering the card deck if it was dropped.  Yes, I
mean cards, the physical type, with rectangular holes.  Also,
<tt>DO10I=1,100</tt> was the same as
<tt>DO 10 I = 1, 100</tt> because <tt>DO</tt>
was a keyword followed by a number and so the space wasn't required,
although it made <tt>DO10I=1</tt> interesting, as that assigned
<tt>1</tt> to a variable named <tt>DO10I</tt>.

<p> I lived this ugliness, so I feel the pain.  But all it really
proved was that FORTRAN's whitespace rules sucked.  License to put
whitespace anywhere has proven to be expensive and cycle-wasting
in practice.  We're not editing on punched cards anymore, and
reformatters are as common as spam.  We can use this power -- type
code however you want to but before you compile it, reformat it (or
reformat on the fly, whatever).

<p> In the end, this requires only that editors and IDEs used by
coders will let the user type stuff and it will make it look right.
This is basically just reformatting on the fly, which many editors
already do.  We don't need you to type zero, one or seventeen spaces
between an <tt>if</tt> and its open paren, we just need the editor
(assuming K&amp;R C) to put exactly one space there.  And getting even
this right will be easier if there is only one style to worry about.
It's one of those things that those reformatting or style adapting
cycles can go to.

<p> Basically, freedom for formatting style has proven extremely
expensive, and does not deliver much value for cost.  Think of it
this way: Could you honestly fill in the following:

<blockquote> I, <i>[insert name here],</i> know of a programming
    style whose impact on programmer productivity and/or program
    quality is large enough that my freedom to choose it over any
    major common style validates the programmer productivity and
    investment used industry wide in arguing about style, imposing
    style, and reformatting to match styles.  That style is <i>[insert
    style description here]</i> and its benefits are <i>[insert
    benefits here].</i> </blockquote>
<p> Or even the less demanding:

<blockquote> I, <i>[insert name here],</i> know of a programming
    style whose impact on programmer productivity and/or program
    quality is &gt;= 5% when compared to any major common style.  That
    style is <i>[insert style description here]</i> and its benefits
    are <i>[insert benefits here].</i> </blockquote>
<p> I think you will mostly get snickers even suggesting that this
can be filled out.  And even on a single project you can spend 5%
on coding style issues -- mostly up front, but it's a continuous
bleeding as style wars crop up over things as yet undefined; new
tools are suggested, written, or integrated; people forget to put
it in the right style and then it gets corrected and pollutes the
change history; training new people in the style; disciplining
engineers who are uncooperative; and just general bitching, whining
and moaning.

<p> So 5% doesn't even touch the opportunity and other costs
associated with not having a mandated style across all the code in
the world.

<p> Or if you prefer the question the other way 'round:  What
benefits do we get from freedom of style that outweighs the cost
we pay for it?

<p> To me the answer seems obvious: Nowhere <i>near</i> enough.
